  <h1><span lang="zh-hans">第九章 意志的“求和运算”</span><span lang="en">Chapter 9. The "Summation Operation" of the Will</span></h1>

<p lang="zh-hans">【<b>本章提要：</b>个人意志向量求和的方法是在经验范围内随时选举“和载体”。“和载体”再以递进的层块不断求出更大的向量分和，最终求出社会意志。】</p>
<p lang="en">Chapter synopsis: The method of vector summation of individual will is to elect “sum carrier” at any time within the empirical range. The “sum carrier” then continuously calculate larger vector partial sums in recursive hierarchical layers, and finally derive the societal will.</p>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_41">9.1 <span lang="zh-hans">“他者”不可承担</span><span lang="en">"Others" are Not Responsible</span></h2>

<p lang="zh-hans">如果说社会意志是正确本身，社会发展就是为了实现社会意志，那么首先要能进行具体的“求和运算”，以获得真实的社会意志。凡是不能进行具体“求和运算”的概念，都免不了被权力窃取利用。例如功利主义视社会幸福为个人幸福的总和，追求“最大多数人的最大幸福”，因为个人幸福不可通约而无法“求和运算”， 结果便被权力打着追求最大社会幸福的旗号，或者走专制主义——例如号称剥夺富人能提高多数穷人的幸福而使社会幸福总和增加，最终反而变成对社会的全面剥夺；或者走向物质主义——例如把幸福简化为经济数字，等同可以用客观指标衡量的利益，最终与社会正义背道而驰。</p>

<p lang="en">If societal will is correct in itself, societal development is to achieve societal will. First and foremost, concrete "summation operations" must be performed to obtain the true societal will. Concepts that cannot undergo concrete "summation operations" are inevitably susceptible to being seized and exploited by power. For example, utilitarianism regards social happiness as the sum of individual happiness, pursuing the "greatest happiness for the greatest number." Since individual happiness cannot be universally measured and subjected to "summation operations," it ends up being manipulated by power in the name of pursuing the greatest overall social happiness or leaning towards authoritarianism. For instance, claiming that depriving the rich can increase the happiness of the majority of the poor and thus increase the overall social happiness may ultimately result in comprehensive deprivation of society. Alternatively, it may veer towards materialism by simplifying happiness into economic figures, equating it with objectively measurable interests, ultimately deviating from societal justice.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">其实无论哪种思想学说，归根结底的追溯都可抵达个人意志——契约由个人意志相互达成；幸福需由人的意志感知和认定。那么与其使用契约、幸福总量那些概念，何不直接归结到个人意志，以及个人意志之和的社会意志？如果能找到求和个人意志的具体方法，契约论和功利主义面对的问题即可迎刃而解。</p>
<p lang="en">In fact, regardless of any philosophical doctrine, the ultimate trace can lead to individual will—the contract is reached by the mutual agreement of individual wills, and happiness needs to be perceived and recognized by the will of individuals. So, instead of using concepts like contracts and the total quantity of happiness, why not directly trace it back to individual will and the societal will as the sum of individual wills? If a specific method for summing individual wills can be found, the issues faced by contract theory and utilitarianism can be readily resolved.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">如何对所有社会成员的个人意志进行向量求和的运算，得到社会意志呢？对千百万复杂多变的个人意志，没有任何“他者”—— 不管多强大的政府或再先进的电脑——有能力处理那种天量且瞬息万变的信息。按照前面给出的算式（2<sup>n-1</sup>-1），不要说国家，仅在一千人规模的群体中，理论上可能发生的最大关系数即达到 5.35754304 × 10 的 300 次方。那是一个 301 位的整数，以地球上任何数的概念都无法把握。即使全世界人人都像当今最快的超级电脑（2016 年是中国研制的“神威·太湖之光” Sunway TaihuLight）那样，每秒钟可以数 93×10^15 个数，昼夜不停地数上 46 亿年（地球迄今的寿命），全人类加在一块也才能数到 37 位整数。这只是以数数代替一千人可能发生的关系，还不是真实的关系。</p>
<p lang="en">How to perform vector summation operations on the individual wills of all members of society to obtain societal will? There is no "other" capable of handling the enormous and rapidly changing information from the complex and diverse individual wills of millions or billions of people—no matter how powerful the government or advanced the computer. According to the formula provided earlier (2<sup>n-1</sup>-1), even in a group as small as 1000 people, the theoretically possible maximum number of relationships would be 5.35754304 × 10^300. That's a 301-digit integer, a concept beyond any number on Earth. Even if every person in the world could count as fast as the fastest supercomputer today (the "Sunway TaihuLight" developed by China in 2016), which can count 93×10^15 numbers per second and counts without stopping for 4.6 billion years (the current age of the Earth), all of humanity together could only count to a 37-digit integer. This is just replacing the possible relationships of one thousand people with counting, not the actual relationships.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">唯一能承担个人意志向量求和的，是所有参与求和的个人意志。这个说法自身的逻辑已能证明这个结论——因为要个人意志承担的，正是个人意志所做的，如果个人意志不能承担，也就不会做。</p>
<p lang="en">The only entity capable of undertaking the vector summation of individual wills is the all individual wills participating in the summation. The logic of this statement itself can prove this conclusion—because what individual wills have to bear is precisely what they have done, and if individual wills cannot bear it, they would not want to do it.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">而个人意志相互自我求和的“运算”，即是直接交流、协商与取得共识的自组织过程。因为自组织的规模受限于充分直接沟通的限度，下文先看在小规模自组织内如何实现个人意志的向量求和，然后再看能否扩大自组织的规模，实现更大范围的求和。</p>
<p lang="en">The "operation" of individual wills mutually summing themselves is the process of self-organization through direct communication, negotiation, and consensus building. Since the scale of self-organization is limited by the extent of direct communication, the following discussion first explores how the vector summation of individual wills can be achieved within small-scale self-organizations. Later, we'll consider whether it is possible to expand the scale of self-organization to achieve a larger scope of summation.</p>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_42">9.2 <span lang="zh-hans">个人意志的向量求和</span><span lang="en">Vector summation of individual will</span></h2>

<p lang="zh-hans">每个人对不同问题会有不同的意志；不同人对同样的问题会有不同意志。这使个人意志的向量求和看上去非常复杂。但只要能做到下面四点，向量求和便会自然完成。</p>
<p lang="en">Everyone will have a different will on different issues; Different people have different wills on the same issue. This complexity makes the vector summation of individual wills appear intricate. However, as long as the following four points can be achieved, vector summation will naturally be completed.</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_43" class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span lang="zh-hans">条件一 充分沟通</span><span lang="en">Condition 1: sufficient communication</span></h3>

<p lang="zh-hans">沟通的充分性和沟通范围的大小成反比。我把可充分直接沟通的范围称为“经验范围”。经验范围并非仅指全天候相处的生活共同体，在现代社会更多是指工作单元、居住单元或“项目”（兴趣组织、利益团体、合作生意，或几人策划合作等都可视为“项目”）。不管采用何种沟通方式，面对面也好，网上交流也好，都属直接沟通。其实任何组织的任何单元广义上都可视为“项目”。“项目”参与者不像生活共同体成员那样了解彼此的各个面向，但只要在“项目”上直接沟通，以经验接触，了解彼此与“项目”有关的面向，就足以让他们在与“项目”有关的面向上进行个人意志的向量求和。</p>
<p lang="en">The sufficiency of communication is inversely proportional to the size of the communication scope. I refer to the range that can be sufficiently communicated directly as the "empirical range". The empirical range does not only refer to a community where people interact regularly but, in modern society, more commonly refers to work units, residential units, or "projects" (interest groups, advocacy organizations, cooperative businesses, or collaborations involving a few individuals, all can be considered "projects"). Regardless of the communication method, whether face-to-face or online, it falls under direct communication. In fact, any unit of any organization can broadly be seen as a "project". Participants in a "project" may not have knowledge of each other's various aspects like members of a communal living group, but as long as they directly communicate within the "project", have empirical interactions, and understand each other's aspects related to the "project", it is enough for them to carry out the vector summation of personal will on aspects related to the "project".</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">不同“项目”的经验范围，规模限度是不同的，只要能针对“项目”的内容进行充分的直接沟通，就属于经验范围。经验范围内的个人意志之所以能做到向量求和，以下几点相互关联：</p>
<p lang="en">The empirical range of different “projects” has different scale limits. As long as there is sufficient direct communication about the content of the “project”, it falls within the empirical range. The reason why the individual wills within the empirical range can achieve vector summation is interrelated based on the following points:</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">充分直接沟通不意味取得一致，而是能够了解对方，仍然各执己见只是彼此无法说服对方，协商则是让各方取得妥协。</p>
<p lang="en">Sufficient direct communication does not imply unanimity but the ability to understand each other. Remaining in disagreement means being unable to convince each other, while negotiation allows all parties to reach a compromise.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">向量求和即是所有成员在充分沟通基础上反复协商达成共识的过程。</p>
<p lang="en">Vector summation is the process of all members repeatedly negotiating and reaching consensus based on sufficient communication.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">经验范围使群体每个成员信息对称，了解其他成员的状况及全局状况，清楚自己在“竞争－合作”曲线上的最佳点，知道他人的反应及底线，以及到哪步该退让，妥协到什么程度，进行步骤和怎样落实……直到达成精确平衡，这种动态协商的“讨价还价”才会终止。</p>
<p lang="en">The empirical range creates information symmetry among all members of the group, enabling an understanding of the conditions of other members and the overall situation. Individuals are aware of their optimal position on the "competition-cooperation" curve, understand the reactions and bottom lines of others, know when to concede and to what extent, plan the steps and how to implement them... until reaching a precise balance. Only then does this dynamic negotiation "bargaining" come to an end.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">虽然对 b) 存在各种质疑，但不可否认多数人具有基于利害考量的理性。如果没有这一点，人类社会将没有合作，不存在秩序，奖赏和惩戒体系都会无效。事实显然并非如此。即使的确有人看上去不符合 b) 描述的理性，从功利角度衡量似乎“不智”，其仍是在追求个人意志的满足（哪怕只为赌气或炫耀），符合人的基本性质。</p>
<p lang="en">While there are various doubts about the existence of b), it cannot be denied that the majority of people have a rationality based on considerations of interests. Without this, human society would lack cooperation, order, and reward and punishment systems would be ineffective. The facts are clearly not so. Even if there are individuals who may appear to deviate from the rationality described by b), assessing them from a utilitarian perspective may seem "imprudent," but they are still pursuing the satisfaction of individual will (even if it's just to show off or be rebellious), aligning with the fundamental nature of humans.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">最终达成的共识即是个人意志的向量和，也是该经验范围的“共同体意志”。</p>
<p lang="en">The ultimately reached consensus is both the vector sum of individual wills and the "communal will" of that empirical range.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_44" class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span lang="zh-hans">条件二 形成默契</span><span lang="en">Condition 2: Forming a tacit understanding</span></h3>

<p lang="zh-hans">对于充分沟通，语言无疑是重要的，但语言不一定能准确表达。很多人不仅难以厘清完整的个人意志是什么，即使是针对具体问题的个别意志，也常有“说不清”的感觉，或是化成语言就走样。语言的日常表述往往以偏概全、偏离主题，甚至言不由衷……全以语言进行个人意志的向量求和，即便最终能做到，协商成本也会非常高，且达成的共识在落实到语言的一刻起就开始落后于事态发展。</p>
<p lang="en">In the process of sufficient communication, language undoubtedly plays a crucial role, but it does not always accurately convey thoughts. Many individuals struggle not only to articulate their complete individual will but also to express specific will on particular issues. There is often a sense of difficulty in articulating thoughts, or they may be distorted when translated into language. Daily language tends to generalize, deviate from the main topic, or even lack sincerity. Relying solely on language for the vector summation of individual wills, even if achievable in the end, comes with a high cost of negotiation, and the consensus reached may lag behind the development of the situation as it is expressed in language.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">因此，个人意志的向量求和仅靠语言是不够的，还需要语境。语言中的每个词、每句话都是活的，蕴涵着可意会不可言传的背景、心机、差异、暗示、态度……个人意志的向量特征更多地存在于语境中。没有语境，个人意志的向量求和会损失很大一部分。所谓充分直接沟通的经验范围，最重要就是有语境，使得经验范围的语言不是孤立抽象的概念，有“历史”且“象形”，能实现全息的沟通。</p>
<p lang="en">Therefore, relying solely on language for the vector summation of individual will is not enough; context is also necessary. Every word and sentence in language is alive, containing implicit backgrounds, intricacies, differences, hints, attitudes, and more that can be understood but not explicitly conveyed. The characteristics of the vector of individual will exist more in the context. Without context, a significant portion of the vector summation of individual will would be lost. The crucial aspect of the empirical range in sufficient direct communication is having context, allowing the language within the empirical range not to be isolated and abstract but to have a "history" and "pictorial" quality, enabling holistic communication.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">把握语境主要靠默契。“默契”一般指无需通过语言的心领神会，通常用于形容合作佳境，但竞争也可以是默契的。当甲能切实揣摩出乙的底线，对乙的要求适可而止，乙也心照不宣地做出收敛，一样是高水平的默契。现实中无论是合作的默契还是竞争的默契皆处处可见。语言协商只能是间断的，默契却可时时进行；语言协商耗时耗力，默契几乎无需成本。个人意志的向量求和，有了随时存在且无成本的默契，才能成为日常应用。</p>
<p lang="en">Grasping context primarily relies on tacit understanding. "Tacit understanding" generally refers to an intuitive comprehension without the need for explicit language and is often used to describe an optimal state of cooperation, although competition can also involve tacit understanding. When person A can genuinely sense person B's bottom line and make reasonable demands without going too far, and person B silently responds with restraint, it is a high-level tacit understanding. In reality, both cooperative and competitive tacit understandings are prevalent. Language negotiations can only be intermittent, while tacit understanding can be ongoing; language negotiations are time-consuming and resource-intensive, while tacit understanding requires almost no cost. For the vector summation of individual will to be applied in daily life, it needs the presence of instant and cost-free tacit understanding.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">默契与形成文字的法规、合约，以及“丑话说在前面”或“亲兄弟明算账”的明说并不矛盾。默契只是日常沟通和操作的一种方法，与白纸黑字形成互补。递进自组织当然离不开语言的讨论协商、形成表述、做出规定、达成合约、制作精心推敲的法律文件。对于数量求和结构，自上而下的沟通相对单一，容易以统一的文字语言强令执行，但是对于自下而上人人参与的向量求和结构，相当于协商和决策过程加入了众多变量，复杂性以指数剧增，离开默契方式便会遇到难以克服的操作障碍。</p>
<p lang="en">Tacit understanding and the formulation of written regulations, contracts, as well as upfront statements like "let's be clear from the start" or "close kin, clear accounts" are not contradictory. Tacit understanding is just one method of everyday communication and operation, complementing the clarity of written words. Recursive self-organization certainly involves discussions, negotiations in language, formulation of expressions, establishment of rules, contract agreements, and the creation of meticulously crafted legal documents. For a top-down communication structure—scalar summation, it tends to be relatively straightforward, as unified written language can be enforced. However, in a bottom-up structure where everyone participates in vector summation, it introduces numerous variables to the negotiation and decision-making process, exponentially increasing complexity. Without relying on tacit understanding, it may encounter operational obstacles that are challenging to overcome.</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_45" class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span lang="zh-hans">条件三 “和载体”</span><span lang="en">Condition 3 "Sum carrier"</span></h3>

<p lang="zh-hans">一对一的默契容易实现，自然互动即可达到。群体默契则麻烦。例如甲与乙有分歧时，丙与甲默契，就不能与乙默契，反之亦然。</p>
<p lang="en">A one-on-one tacit understanding is easily achieved through natural interaction. Group-level tacit understanding is troublesome. For instance, if there is a disagreement between A and B, and C tacitly understands A, then they may not have a tacitly understand with B, and vice versa.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">理论上，群体默契可以通过重复博弈与整合得到。每人经过与其他人不断地沟通、揣测、试探和较量，反复互动，逐一对比、综合、修正，最后认识到能统一大家的默契究竟何在，再将自己置于合适位置。当群体成员都做到这一点时，整个群体的默契即实现。</p>
<p lang="en">In theory, group-level tacit understanding can be achieved through repeated games and integration. Through continuous communication, speculation, testing, and competition among individuals, along with repeated interactions, each person can compare, synthesize, and adjust their perspectives. Eventually, they will recognize the common ground for tacit understanding that unifies everyone and position themselves accordingly. When all members of the group achieve this, the entire group's tacit understanding is realized.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">可想这种方式的复杂繁琐，群体的人数稍多，默契所需要的排列组合关系即会急剧增长（如前述的2<sup>n-1</sup>-1）。简化办法是建立一个公共点，成员各自与公共点互动，将一对多的关系变成一对一的关系。当所有成员都与公共点达成整合时，公共点即是所有成员个人意志的向量之和。公共点因此可称为“和载体”。</p>
<p lang="en">It can be imagined that this method is complicated and cumbersome, as the number of people in the group increases slightly, the combinatorial relationships required for tacit understanding will grow dramatically (as mentioned earlier, 2<sup>n-1</sup>-1). A simplified approach is to establish a common hub where each member interacts with the common hub, transforming a one-to-many relationship into a one-to-one relationship. When all members integrate with the common hub, it becomes the vector sum of the personal will of all members. Therefore, the common hub can be called the "sum carrier" or "consensus carrier."</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">方案可以作为语言形式的“和载体”。每个成员各自对方案进行判断和修正，再对其他成员关于方案的意见进行表态。方案从草案到定稿的过程是个人意志向量求和的过程，定稿便是求出的向量和。不过正如前面所说，语言形式有诸多缺陷，成本过高，日常所需的众多决策也不可能事无巨细一一提出方案，再反复修正。</p>
<p lang="en">The proposal can serve as the "consensus carrier" in the form of written language. Each member evaluates and adjusts the proposal, then expresses their opinions on the proposal from draft to finalization. The process from draft to final version is the process of vector summation of individual wills, and the final version represents the calculated vector sum. However, as mentioned earlier, there are many limitations to the form of written language, and the cost is too high. It is not feasible to propose and repeatedly revise numerous decisions in daily situations.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">既然默契是向量求和的有效方式，更好的“和载体”应该是自身就具备默契能力。可想而知，那只能是人。既然经验范围内每个成员皆有默契能力，从中选出一人“心领神会”地与群体各个成员主动默契，进行整合，从而以其主动决策取代实际协商过程，又能忠实和完整地体现向量和，操作成本可以降到最低，耗时也最少。</p>
<p lang="en">Since tacit understanding is an effective way of vector summation, a better "sum carrier" should inherently possess the ability to establish tacit understanding. It's easy to understand that this carrier can only be a person. Since each member within the empirical range has the ability to establish tacit understanding, selecting one person who can intuitively establish tacit understanding with each member of the group, integrate their perspectives, and replace the actual negotiation process with proactive decision-making, can faithfully and completely reflect the vector sum. This approach minimizes operational costs and time consumption.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">以人充当“和载体”的逻辑与优越在于：</p>
<p lang="en">The logic and superiority of using individual as "sum carriers" lies in:</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">经验范围内的“和载体”可以准确地预知每个成员的立场与态度，了解他们的具体要求和愿望，想象得出他们之间每步协商的讨价还价、如何互动，以及各自的底线……“和载体”因此能以默契近乎精确地求出向量之和。</p>
    <p lang="en">The "sum carrier" within the empirical range can accurately anticipate the stance and attitudes of each member, understand their specific demands and desires, imagine the negotiations, interactions, and compromises at each step, as well as their respective bottom lines. Therefore, the "sum carrier" can almost precisely calculate the vector sum with tacit understanding.</p></li>

    <li><p lang="zh-hans">由于经验范围可充分沟通，“和载体”处于全体成员监督下，其出现任何偏离都会随时被要求进行修正，直到与向量和一致；</p>
    <p lang="en">Due to the sufficient communication within the empirical range, the "sum carrier" is under the supervision of all members. Any deviation from the sum carrier will be promptly requested for correction until it aligns with the vector sum.</p></li>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_46" class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span lang="zh-hans">条件四 随时选举</span><span lang="en">Condition 4: Elections at any time</span></h3>

<p lang="zh-hans">问题于是归结到该由什么人担当“和载体”？如何保证“和载体”始终忠于共同体意志？以及在发生偏离时能立刻纠正？——不难想到，唯有选举。</p>
<p lang="en">The question then boils down to who should assume the role of the "sum carrier"? How to ensure that the "sum carrier" remains loyal to the communal will? And how can deviations be immediately corrected when they occur? It is not difficult to think that only through elections can these be achieved.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">这种选举须有两个限定：一是必须在经验范围内选举，二是可以随时选举。</p>
<p lang="en">This type of election must have two constraints: firstly, it must be within the empirical range, and secondly, election can be held at any time.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">选举也是一种求和。不像只能表达“赞成”或“反对”的数量选举，经验范围的选举是向量选举，能充分直接沟通，可以完整地表达每个选举者的意志——参选人或被清楚地告知，或被含蓄地暗示，每个选举者对其赞成、反对、部分赞成、部分反对，理由究竟何在；并非仅仅是完成选举的过程，而是共同体意志的向量求和过程……既有语言交流，更多是默契感应。选举者会有不同意见，最终通过协商和妥协选出的人，其当选是共同体的意志，其本身也在当选的一刻成为共同体意志的载体。</p>
<p lang="en">Elections are also a summation of individual wills. Unlike elections that merely express the scalar of "for" or "against," empirical range elections are vector, allowing for direct and sufficient communication. They enable each member to fully articulate their wills—whether conveyed explicitly or subtly implied. Each member expresses their degree of support, opposition, partial agreement, partial disagreement, and the reasons behind their will. It's not just a process of completing the election; rather, it's a vector summation of the collective will of the community. This involves not only verbal communication but also a sense of mutual tacit understanding. Each member may have differing opinions, and the individual elected through negotiation and compromise ultimately represents the will of the community, becoming the "sum carrier" of the community's will at the moment of election.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">但是，既然人人都追求个人意志的满足，如何保证当选者不以自己意志为主，而是始终忠实地充当“和载体”呢？当然不能指望当选者可以自觉放弃个人追求。那即使一时半刻做得到，也绝不会持久。根本的制约在于——只要当选者偏离共同体意志，便能立刻将其罢免，更换新人。</p>
<p lang="en">However, since everyone seeks the satisfaction of their individual will, how can we ensure that the elected representatives do not prioritize their own will but consistently act as faithful "sum carriers"? Naturally, one cannot expect elected representatives to willingly give up personal pursuits. Even if they manage to do so temporarily, it is unlikely to be sustainable. The fundamental constraint lies in the fact that as soon as an elected representative deviates from the communal will, they can be immediately removed from office, and a new person can take their place.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">因此要求对“和载体”的选举可以随时进行，而非固定任期。这是选举的一个重大变化。大规模人群的选举劳民伤财，只能定期举行。而经验范围的选举不用经费，不费时间，不用主持，无需竞选，也没有选民登记、投票程序和选票统计等繁琐程序，能在任何时间被任何成员启动。</p>
<p lang="en">Therefore, it is required that elections for the "sum carrier" can be conducted at any time, rather than having fixed terms. This represents a significant change in the electoral process. Large-scale elections involving the masses are resource-intensive and can only be held periodically. In contrast, empirical range elections incur no costs, take no time, require no administration, do not involve campaigning, and lack the cumbersome procedures of voter registration, voting processes, and ballot counting. They can be initiated by any member at any time.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">一旦可以随时选举，便会产生一个重要且奇妙的效果——当选者履行职责的每一步都相当于面临重新选举。那选举并不实际发生，只是因为有随时发生的可能，便会先在当选者头脑里模拟进行。当选者为了避免随时选举将其罢免，必须时时事事追随共同体意志，及时修正任何微小的偏离，从而始终保持为精确的“和载体”。</p>
<p lang="en">Once elections can be held at any time, it leads to an important and intriguing outcome—every step taken by the elected representative in fulfilling their duties is akin to facing a potential re-election. While actual elections may not occur frequently, the possibility of them happening at any moment prompts a constant mental simulation in the elected representative's mind. To avoid the risk of being removed through an impromptu election, elected representatives must continuously align with the collective will of the community, promptly correcting any minor deviations. This ensures that they consistently function as an accurate "sum carrier".</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">因此，有了随时选举的可能，不等于选举会随时发生，却因为有了随时选举的可能，促使当选者总是不懈地追随共同体意志，不断修正偏离，反而使重新选举变得没有必要，真的选举反倒可能更少发生。</p>
<p lang="en">Therefore, the possibility of elections at any time doesn't necessarily mean that elections will happen frequently. Rather, the potential for impromptu elections encourages elected representatives to consistently align with the collective will, making continuous corrections to avoid deviations. Paradoxically, this may render the need for actual re-elections unnecessary, as the constant adherence to the community's will reduces the likelihood of significant deviations that would trigger such elections.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">随时选举的“含而不发”带来另一个效果，即共同体只需进行选举“和载体”的向量求和，就能实现对共同体其他事务的向量求和，却不必真对那些事务进行向量求和。其机制在于，共同体内所有个人意志对每件事的向量求和，会从现实转到当选者的头脑中进行。因为有随时选举的制约，当选者的默契、修正和整合始终会与共同体意志（即所有成员个人意志的向量和）保持一致，与真正进行向量求和的结果完全吻合，因此不再需要实际进行向量求和。若非如此，即使在经验范围，个人意志的向量求和也是不可能时刻进行、成为日常操作的。</p>
<p lang="en">The "implicit but not expressed" nature of impromptu elections brings about another effect. In this case, the community only needs to perform the vector summation for the "sum carrier", and this automatically achieves the vector summation for other community affairs without the need for a direct vector summation for those specific matters. The mechanism behind this is that the vector summation of individual wills within the community for each matter is transferred from reality to the mind of the elected representative. Due to the constraints of impromptu elections, the tacit understanding, corrections, and integration of the elected representative will consistently align with the collective will of the community (i.e., the vector sum of the individual wills of all members). It perfectly coincides with the actual vector summation result, eliminating the need for a practical vector summation. Without this mechanism, even within the empirical range, constant vector summation of individual wills would be practically impossible and not a daily operation.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">以上四个条件在现实中皆可自然产生，经验范围的默契随处可见；即使不被称为“和载体”，小规模人群中自然形成的领袖往往就是这种角色，相当于出自人们心中的随时选举。这正是现实中生生不息的自组织。只要是关系平等的经验范围，自组织会自然形成。但是问题在于：凡是有生命力的自组织，规模一定会不断地扩大，因此总会超过充分直接沟通的限度，不再是经验范围。那时便要建立间接沟通的结构，于是又回到沟通枢纽把枢纽位置据为私有、自组织变成 “权组织+被组织”、向量求和变成数量求和的起点。然而在本文的论证中，这一圈并不白绕，它突显出超越这种循环的关键——必须找到一种方法，既能始终保持经验范围内的充分直接沟通，又能让自组织的规模不断扩大。只有这样，才能扩大个人意志的向量求和，最终实现社会意志的向量求和。</p>
<p lang="en">The four conditions mentioned above can naturally emerge in reality, with tacit understandings prevalent within empirical ranges. Even without being termed "sum carrier", leaders that naturally form in small groups often assume this role, akin to an impromptu election emerging from people's hearts. This is the ongoing self-organization observed in reality. As long as there is an empirical range with equal relationships, self-organization will naturally occur. However, the problem arises when any self-organizing entity with vitality will inevitably expand in scale, surpassing the limits of direct communication. At that point, structures for indirect communication need to be established. This leads back to a communication hub, where the hub position becomes proprietary, and self-organization transforms into a "power organization + been organized" structure. The vector summation transforms into a starting point for scalar summation. Yet, in the argument presented in this text, this cycle is not in vain. It highlights the crucial aspect of transcending this loop—there must be a way to consistently maintain direct communication within empirical ranges while allowing the scale of self-organization to expand continuously. Only in this way can the vector summation of individual wills be broadened, ultimately achieving the vector summation of societal will.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">由n户村民组成的村民组是经验范围，选出村民组长作为“和载体”，按自组织方式实现了n户村民意志的向量求和。那么再往上一级的行政村，该如何实现全村个人意志的向量求和呢？</p>
<p lang="en">The villagers' group formed by n households constitutes an empirical range, where the village head is elected as the "sum carrier," achieving the vector summation of the wills of n households through a self-organizing approach.

<p lang="zh-hans">假设行政村有一千位村民，超过充分直接沟通的范围，无论用默契还是用语言，不管是协商还是选举，都得不到向量之和。选出的当选者也无法靠默契求和一千村民的个人意志。当其权力意志与共同体意志发生偏离，村民既不能及时发现，也无法随时选举。而千人规模的定期选举需要依赖主持人，占据主持位置的当权者只进行有利自己的沟通，限制不利自己的沟通，往往能继续当选——这正是中国现行“村民自治”的现状。</p>
<p lang="en">Suppose an administrative village has 1000 residents, surpassing the range of sufficient direct communication. Regardless of whether it is through tacit understanding or language, and whether it involves negotiation or elections, the vector summation cannot be achieved for such a large number of people. Elected representatives are also unable to intuitively sum up the individual wills of a thousand villagers through tacit understanding. When there is a deviation between their personal will and the collective will of the community, the villagers cannot promptly detect it, and impromptu elections are not feasible. Moreover, regular elections for a community of 1000 people require facilitators, and those in power who occupy the position of facilitator tend to communicate in ways favorable to themselves while limiting unfavorable communication. This often leads to them being re-elected time and time again—this is the current reality of "village autonomy" in China.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">超出经验范围便无法实现个人意志的向量求和，但是能不能对n个村民组各自求得的向量和再进行向量求和，而得到行政村所有个人意志的向量和呢？按照向量求和原理，把向量分组，每组求出向量分和后，再对向量分和进行向量求和，所得结果与对所有向量直接求和完全一致。</p>
<p lang="en">Beyond the empirical range, it becomes impossible to achieve the vector summation of individual wills. However, is it possible to take the vectors obtained from each of the n villagers' groups, perform a vector summation on each group, and then sum those group vector summations to obtain the vector summation of all individual wills within the administrative village? According to the principles of vector summation, by grouping vectors, calculating the vector summation for each group, and then summing those group vector summations, the result will be identical to directly summing all individual vectors.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">村民组长作为“和载体”所承载的本组共同体意志，正是这样的向量分和。因此对各组长承载的共同体意志进行向量求和，得到的结果应该就是全村个人意志的向量和——也就是政村的共同体意志。</p>
<p lang="en">The collective will of the group carried by the villager group leader as the "sum carrier" is precisely such a vector sum.

<p lang="zh-hans">问题在于，n个组长参与求和的意志到底是其个人意志，还是其当选村民组的共同体意志？只有保证组长之间进行向量分和的求和，得到的才是行政村全体村民个人意志的向量和。这要求组长不仅在村民组内作为“和载体”，在组长之间进行求和时仍要保持作为村民组的“和载体”进行向量求和，这是关键。</p>
<p lang="en">The issue lies in whether the wills brought into the summation by the n villager group leaders are their individual will or the collective will of the village group they represent. It is only by ensuring that the vector summation among the villager group leaders is based on the collective will of their respective village groups that we can obtain the vector summation of the individual wills of all villagers in the administrative village. This requires that the villager group leaders, while serving as the "sum carrier" within their village groups, also maintain their role as the "sum carrier" of the village group when participating in the vector summation among themselves. This is crucial.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">保证这一点的是自下而上的“层块”结构。层块是跨层次的，必须在上下关系中存在。在层块结构中，中间层次的任何节点同时属于上下两个层块。村民组长既属于选举其的村民组，同时属于上一级层块——村民组长的共同体。在村民组的层块，村民组长是当选者，是“和载体”；在上一级层块，村民组长是普通成员，选举“和载体”。两个层块是分不开的。</p>
<p lang="en">This is guaranteed by a bottom-up "layered" structure. The layers are cross-cutting and must exist in a hierarchical relationship. In the layered structure, any node in the middle layer belongs simultaneously to both the upper and lower layers. Villager group leaders belong to the village group that elected them and, at the same time, belong to the upper-layer structure—the community of villager group leaders. Within the layer of the village group, the villager group leader is the elected representative, the "sum carrier"; in the upper-layer structure, the villager group leader is an ordinary member participating in the election of the "sum carrier." These two layers are inseparable.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">在层块结构中，村民组成员对他们选举的组长能够时刻进行制约（随时选举），组长在上一级层块就只能作为村民组的“和载体”参与行政村的求和，否则便会被本组成员以随时选举更换。</p>
<p lang="en">In the layered structure, members of the village group can constantly constrain the group leader they elected (through impromptu elections). In the upper-layer structure, the group leader can only function as the "sum carrier" of the village group when participating in the summation of the administrative village. Otherwise, the members of the village group can replace the group leader through impromptu elections.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">只要能确保村民组长始终以 “和载体”的身份参与行政村的向量求和，村民组长们选举的上一级“和载体”——行政村主任，就会同时是行政村所有村民个人意志的“和载体”。</p>
<p lang="en">As long as it can be ensured that the villager group leader consistently participate in the vector summation of the administrative village as the "sum carrier," the upper-level "sum carrier" elected by the villager group leaders—the director of the administrative village—will simultaneously serve as the "sum carrier" for the individual wills of all villagers in the administrative village.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">由此便解决了经验范围对个人意志向量求和的限制，能够在更大范围实现求和。村民组—行政村只是上下两级层块，继续扩展更多级层块，结构和原理与之是相同的，只需把其中的村民组长换成行政村主任、乡长、县长或市长……每个角色都是双重身份——既是下一层的“和载体”，又是上一层的向量求和参与者；既是下一层的当选者，又是上一层的选举者；既是下一层委员会的主任，又是上一层委员会的委员…… 自下而上地如此延伸层块结构，个人意志向量求和的人数规模便可以不断扩大，却始终不脱离经验范围。</p>
<p lang="en">Thus, the limitations of the empirical range on the vector summation of individual wills are overcome, enabling summation on a larger scale. The village group to the administrative village represents just two levels of the layered structure. By continuing to expand with more levels, the structure and principles remain the same; only the village group leader needs to be replaced with the director of the administrative village, the township head, the county head, or the city mayor. Each role has a dual identity—serving as both the "sum carrier" for the lower level and a participant in the vector summation for the upper level; acting as both the elected representative for the lower level and the one conducting elections for the upper level; functioning as both the director of the lower-level committee and a member of the upper-level committee. By extending this layered structure from bottom to top, the scale of vector summation of individual wills can continually expand without departing from the empirical range.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">对于发明和设计而言，经验范围和自组织都是自然存在，古已有之，不足为奇，谈得上突破的是把经验范围和自组织用层块方式搭成递进的结构，从而便能在无限扩大规模的同时，始终保持在既没有权组织又没有被组织的状态——递进自组织。</p>
<p lang="en">For the realms of invention and design, both the empirical range and self-organization are naturally occurring phenomena with a long history, so their existence is not surprising. What can be considered innovative is the construction of an recursive structure using the layered approach for the empirical range and self-organization. This allows for an infinite expansion of scale while consistently maintaining a state that is neither a power organization nor an organized entity—recursive self-organization.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">有了随时选举，理论上可以随时更换在上级层块背离共同体意志的当选者，但是当选者会不会利用层块之间的隔离，使其背离不被选举其的层块发现呢？以下逻辑可以杜绝这种情况：</p>
<p lang="en">With impromptu elections, theoretically, one can replace elected representatives in the upper-level structure who deviate from the collective will at any time. However, is there a possibility that elected representatives may exploit the isolation between layers to deviate without being noticed by the layer that elected them? The following logic can eliminate such a scenario:</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">既然层块是经验范围，层块成员对当选者的充分了解，除了其能力，也包括其为人——究竟可信赖，还是爱搞鬼，是表里如一，还是阳奉阴违，从而事先保证当选者的品德。</p>
	<p lang="en">Given that layers are within the empirical range, members of each layer have a comprehensive understanding of the elected representatives. This understanding extends beyond their capabilities to include their character—whether they are trustworthy or deceptive, consistent in their actions, or prone to double-dealing. This ensures, in advance, the moral character of the elected representatives.</p></li>

    <li><p lang="zh-hans">即使隔了层次，层块成员也不会对当选者在上一级层块的作为全不知晓。毕竟上下层块有重叠部分，大事都了解。借用“母子结构”的概念，子结构（下级层块）会对母结构（上级层块）有一定的经验延伸。图14中“子”压住“母”的部分即表示这种延伸，图15是图14的俯视图，可看到每个母结构之下有若干子结构（一个村民组有若干村民家庭，一个行政村有若干村民组……），每个子结构都对母结构有延伸。这使得当选者在上级层块的作为受到多个下级层块的监督。</p>
	<p lang="en">Even with layers in between, members of the lower-level layers will not be completely unaware of the actions of the elected representative in the upper-level layer. After all, there is overlap between the upper and lower-level layers, and important matters are understood. Using the concept of a "mother-son structure," the substructure (lower-level layer block) will have a certain empirical extension to the superstructure (upper-level layer block). In Figure 14, the part where "son" presses against "mother" represents this extension. Figure 15 is a top-down view of Figure 14, showing that beneath each mother structure, there are several substructures (several village households in a village group, several village groups in an administrative village, etc.). Each substructure contributes to the extension of the mother structure. This allows the actions of the elected representative in the upper-level layer to be supervised by multiple lower-level layers.</p></li>

<div><img alt="figure 14 15" src="../Images/14_15.png"/></div>

    <li><p lang="zh-hans">母结构中的任何决策与行为要么直接施加于子结构，要么迟早影响子结构，因此即使一时未发现当选者在上级层块背离了共同体意志，也会因为造成的实际影响而被发现。</p>
	<p lang="en">Any decision or action within the mother structure either directly imposes on the substructure or will eventually influence the substructure. Therefore, even if there is a temporary lack of awareness that elected representatives at the upper-level layer are deviating from the collective will of the community, it will be discovered sooner or later due to the practical impact caused by such deviations.</p></li>

    <li><p lang="zh-hans">当选者在上级层块的行为会处于选举竞争者的密切监督下，也是制约。</p>
	<p lang="en">The actions of elected representatives at upper-level blocks will be under close supervision by electoral competitors, serving as a constraint.</p></li>
</ol>

<p lang="zh-hans">以上针对的是相隔一层的情况，若是隔着多级层块，是否仍然可以保证“和载体”不背离共同体意志？或即使背离也能被随时发现和换人呢？</p>
<p lang="en">The above pertains to situations with one intervening layer. If there are multiple layers in between, can we still ensure that the "sum carrier" does not deviate from the will of the community? Or, even if there is deviation, can it be detected and replaced at any time?</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">首先，不管上升多少层，相应层块的成员仍属同一经验范围。哪怕全球五大洲首长组成世界联邦的顶级层块，驻地相距数千公里，不像村民那样世代交往随时见面，但他们拥有的沟通科技可以弥补。通过全息影像系统开会与同坐一室相差无几，且电流跨越千百公里比人腿从村东走到村西快得多，比同村人见面还方便。他们无疑不会聊张家长李家短，只是共商全球政事，不必了解对方是否忠于妻子，或钓鱼水平高低。然而他们的项目就是全球政事，无关之事毋需沟通。如果有一天是否忠于妻子真与全球政事有关，以各洲首长的情报能力随时可以查清。</p>
<p lang="en">Firstly, regardless of how many layers ascend, members of the corresponding blocks still fall within the same empirical range. Even if the leaders of the five continents form the top-level layer of a world federation, with residences thousands of kilometers apart and lacking the constant interaction seen in village communities, their communication technologies can bridge the gap. Conducting meetings through holographic imaging systems is nearly equivalent to sitting in the same room, and electric currents traverse thousands of kilometers much faster than a person walking from one end of a village to the other, making it more convenient than meeting fellow villagers. Undoubtedly, they won't engage in casual conversation about personal matters; their discussions revolve around global affairs, and there's no need to know whether someone is faithful to their spouse or skilled at fishing. However, if the faithfulness to a spouse ever becomes relevant to global affairs, it can be promptly investigated with the intelligence capabilities of each continent's leaders.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">其次看经验延伸的制约。一般来讲，自下而上的层块经验延伸只适用相邻的母子结构，难跨更高层次。但既然每个层块的选举者都受下级层块经验延伸的制约，基层只要能向上延伸一层，即会通过层层延伸的关系延伸到最高层。图16如同倒下的多米诺骨牌，“最高层”虽不是被“基层”直接压住，但是“最高层”的任何动作都能连锁地传递到“基层”。在这个系列中，所有层块都被“基层”压住，形象地表明递进自组织“基层”的意志要被层层体现和服从。</p>
<p lang="en">Next, let's consider the constraints of empirical extension. Generally, empirical extension from lower to upper layer blocks is typically applicable to adjacent mother-son structures and is challenging to extend across higher levels. However, since the elected representatives of each block are constrained by the empirical extension from the lower-level layers, as long as the grassroots can extend upward by one layer, it will extend to the highest level through a cascading relationship. Figure 16, resembling falling dominoes, illustrates that although the "highest level" is not directly pressed by the "grassroots," any action at the "highest level" can chain react and transmit to the "grassroots." In this series, all layer blocks are pressed down by the "grassroots," symbolizing that the recursively self-organizing will of the "grassroots" is to be reflected and obeyed layer by layer.</p>

<div><img alt="figure 16" src="../Images/16.png"/></div>

<p lang="zh-hans">想象从俯视角度看图16，前面谈的“每个母结构之下有若干子结构”会展示出层层扩展——最高层被若干“次高层”所压，每个“次高层”又被若干“次次高层”所压……一层压一层的每一层都是以多压少，基层的子结构最多，相当于“最高层”被众多的“基层”所制约。</p>
<p lang="en">Imagining the view from above in Figure 16, the earlier discussion of "each mother structure having several substructures beneath it" would demonstrate a layered expansion. The highest level is pressed down by several "sub-high levels," each "sub-high level" is pressed by several "sub-sub-high levels," and so on. Each layer pressing down the layer beneath it represents a situation where more are constraining fewer. The substructures of the grassroots, being the most numerous, equate to the "highest level" being constrained by numerous elements at the grassroots level.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">对分层的主要质疑是传递失真。有人批评——“十次选举选出中央政府，就意味着民意被稀释了九次……只要一次间接选举中民意被曲解或背弃了，即使其他所有的间接选举都严格尊重了选举人的意愿，所产生的政府也是与民意背道而驰的”——若是单纯传递，当然如此。但是层块结构不是层层传递，而是层层求和。社会意志不是从“基层”传递到“最高层”，而是从“基层”求和到“最高层”。既然不是传递过程，就不存在传递失真和被稀释。层块提升只是求和的扩大。每提升一个层次，意味更多的个人意志加入向量求和。较小的向量分和不断地求和为更大的向量分和，直到最终求出社会意志。</p>
<p lang="en">One of the main criticisms of the layered structure is the potential distortion in information transmission. Some argue, "Electing the central government through ten elections means that public opinion is diluted nine times... As long as public opinion is distorted or betrayed in one indirect election, even if all other indirect elections strictly respect the wishes of the electors, the resulting government will go against public opinion". If it were just a matter of layer-to-layer transmission, such issues could indeed arise. However, the block structure is not about layer-to-layer transmission but rather layer-by-layer aggregation. Societal will does not pass from the "grassroots" to the "highest level"; instead, it aggregates from the "grassroots" to the "highest level". Since it's not a transmission process, there is no issue of transmission distortion or dilution. The elevation in block structures is an expansion of aggregation. With each elevation, more individual wills contribute to the summation of vectors. The smaller vector sums continually aggregate into larger vector sums until the final expression of societal will.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">即使从传递角度看，也可以举一个反向例证，专制权力体系有同样多的层次，皇帝只任免其下的大臣，就可通过自上而下逐层任免的阶梯将意志施加给民众。同样逻辑，民众在递进自组织中推举其上一层，再利用逐层递选（相当于权力任免）的序列，为什么不能把民众意志延伸到最高层呢？二者区别只是任免方向调转了180度。事实上，因为自上而下的权力是以少制多，皇帝一人盯一大堆官僚无法做到信息对称；自下而上的权力却是以多制少，每个当选者都受来自多方的时刻监督。从这个角度看，如果专制皇帝能让意志延伸到基层，递进自组织的民众应该更能让意志传递到高层。当然，前者有一套保证的结构，因此后者也需要建立相应的结构。</p>
<p lang="en">Even from a transmission perspective, we can provide a counterexample. In a centralized power system with an equal number of hierarchical levels, the emperor appoints and dismisses only the ministers below him. Through a top-down, step-by-step appointment ladder, the will of the ruler can be imposed on the people. Using the same logic, why couldn't the will of the people be extended to the highest level by electing their upper-level layer in a recursive self-organization manner and employing a sequence akin to hierarchical elections (equivalent to power appointments)? The only difference between the two scenarios is the reversal of the direction of appointments. In fact, because top-down power involves few governing many, an emperor overseeing numerous bureaucrats cannot achieve information symmetry. On the other hand, bottom-up power involves many governing few, and each elected representative is constantly supervised by various sources. From this perspective, if a despotic emperor could extend their will to the grassroots, a recursively self-organizing populace should be even more capable of transmitting their will to the upper levels. Of course, the former has a guaranteed structure, so the latter also needs to establish a corresponding structure.</p>
