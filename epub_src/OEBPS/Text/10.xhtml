  <h1><span lang="zh-hans">第十章、递进自组织</span><span lang="en">Chapter 10. Recursive Self-Organization</span></h1>

<p lang="zh-hans">【<b>本章提要：</b>八条基本规则形成自动运转和自我调节的机制，可生长出递进自组织社会。】</p>
<p lang="en">Chapter synopsis: The eight fundamental rules establish an automatic operation and self-regulation mechanism, capable of giving rise to a recursive self-organization society.</p>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_49">10.1 <span lang="zh-hans">规则</span><span lang="en">Rules</span></h2>

<p lang="zh-hans">实现社会意志的向量求和，须通过覆盖整个社会的递进自组织。现实中覆盖整个社会的组织只有国家政权。本文把国家政权视为 “公权组织”， 以“公权组织”全面实行递进自组织得到社会意志，解决权力意志脱离社会意志的问题。</p>
<p lang="en">To achieve the vector summation of societal will, it requires a recursive self-organization structure that spans the entire society. In reality, the only organization that covers the entire society is the state authority. This article considers the state authority as a "public power organization," advocating for the comprehensive implementation of recursive self-organization by the "public power organization" to obtain societal will and address the issue of power will deviating from societal will.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">除了“公权组织”，还有为生活、生产、信仰、事业等功能和目标而合作的群体，如家族、合作社、职工持股企业、政党、团体、教会、学术组织等，可称“众权组织”。众权组织不要求、但可自愿实行递进自组织。</p>
<p lang="en">In addition to the "public power organization", there are groups that collaborate for functions and objectives related to life, production, belief, career, etc., such as families, cooperatives, employee-owned enterprises, political parties, associations, churches, academic organizations, etc., which can be termed "collective power organizations", Collective power organizations do not require but can voluntarily implement recursive self-organization.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">私有企业或机构为“私权组织”，不实行递进自组织。</p>
<p lang="en">Private enterprises or institutions are considered "private power organizations", and they do not implement recursive self-organization.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">不实行递进自组织的众权组织和私权组织须遵守所属及上级公权组织层块的法律与决策。</p>
<p lang="en">Collective power organizations and private power organizations that do not implement recursive self-organization must adhere to the laws and decisions of the public power organization layer blocks to which they belong and the higher-level layer blocks.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">如此实施当然需要诸多慎重周全的制度设计，但是现在进入细节为时过早。首要的是形成机制。机制无需制度那样面面俱到，实行以下八条基本规则，便会产生自动运行的内驱力，随之“自生自发”出相应秩序细节，并根据反馈自动调节，自我完善。</p>
<p lang="en">Implementing such a system certainly requires careful and comprehensive institutional design, but delving into details at this moment is premature. The primary focus is to establish the mechanism. The mechanism doesn't need to be as exhaustive as an institution; by implementing the following eight fundamental rules, it will generate an internal driving force for automatic operation. Subsequently, corresponding order details will "naturally emerge", and the system will automatically adjust and self-improve based on feedback.</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span lang="zh-hans">规则一</span><span lang="en">Rule 1</span></h3>

<p lang="zh-hans">递进自组织由自下而上逐层递进的层块组成。层块规模不小于四人，不大于层块所有成员皆可充分直接沟通的限度。</p>
<p lang="en">Recursive self-organization is composed of layer blocks that are recursive from bottom to top. The size of each layer is no less than four individuals and no greater than the extent to which all members of layer block can communicate directly and sufficiently.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">a) 限制层块规模是递进自组织的关键之一，是否对此有自觉意识和操作，结果完全不同。前面说过有活力的自组织会自然扩大，不自觉限制，一俟超出经验范围就无法充分沟通，需要靠人主持，进而生成权力，分为二元，自组织即变成“权组织+被组织”。因此必须自觉地限制规模扩大，始终保证层块内部能够实现充分的直接沟通，才可避免以往的怪圈——自组织发展导致扩大规模，扩大规模后便不再是自组织。</p>
	<p lang="en">a) Restricting the size of the layer block within empirical range is one of the crucial aspects of recursive self-organization, and whether there is awareness and operation in this regard makes a significant difference. As mentioned earlier, a dynamic self-organization will naturally expand without conscious limitations. Once it surpasses the empirical range, sufficient communication becomes challenging, requiring facilitator and leading to the emergence of power, resulting in a dualistic structure where self-organization transforms into "power organization + been organized". Therefore, it is imperative to consciously limit the scale expansion, ensuring that there is always sufficient direct communication within the layer block. This conscious limitation is crucial to avoid the paradox where the development of self-organization leads to scale expansion, and once the scale expands, it is no longer truly self-organization.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">b) 根据项目不同，层块规模的限度也不同。判断是否达到限度只需掌握一点——如果离开主持人即无法运转，就是超出了规模限度，层块即应通过再分组，调整到无需主持也能自行运转的规模。</p>
	<p lang="en">b) Depending on the project, the limit of the block size may vary. The key criterion for determining whether the limit is reached is simple: if the layer block cannot operate without a moderator, it has exceeded the size limit. In such a case, the block should be reorganized, adjusting to a size that can operate independently without the need for oversight.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">c) 层块的再分组，要保持新的层块规模不小于四人。因为层块进行重新选举时，原先当选的成员不能参与，基层层块至少还需要有三个其他成员才能进行三分之二决的选举，因此最小规模需要为四人。高层层块虽以票权而非层块成员数计票，但从多元性考虑，也需要保证一定成员数。</p>
	<p lang="en">c) The regrouping of layer blocks must ensure that the new block size is no less than four individuals. This is because, during the re-election of blocks, the previously elected members cannot participate. For grassroots blocks to conduct a two-thirds majority vote election, there must be at least three other members, making the minimum size required four individuals. Although higher-level blocks count votes based on voting rights rather than the number of block members, a certain number of members should still be maintained for diversity considerations.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">d) 依赖主持人和利用主持人不是同一回事。前者没有主持人即无法运转；后者只是为了降低运转成本，没有主持人一样可以运转，或者说任何成员都能起到主持人的作用。如个人意志向量求和所需要的“和载体”可以视为主持人，但在经验范围内选举“和载体”即是无需依赖“和载体”的向量求和——任何成员都能成为选举发起人。正是这一点保证了随时选举，约束“和载体”不能背离向量之和。而超出经验范围，选举必须靠主持人才能进行，主持人就可以操纵选举，其掌握的权力也难免脱离共同体意志。</p>
	<p lang="en">d) Relying on a facilitator and utilizing a facilitator are distinct concepts. The former implies that without a facilitator, the operation cannot proceed, while the latter is about reducing operational costs—operations can still proceed without a facilitator, and any member can take on the role of a facilitator. For instance, the "sum carrier" required for vector summation of individual wills can be viewed as a facilitator, but in the context of electing a "sum carrier" within the empirical range, vector summation does not depend on the facilitator—an election initiator can be any member. This ensures the possibility of elections at any time and constrains the "sum carrier" from deviating from the sum of vectors. However, beyond the empirical range, elections require a facilitator, giving the facilitator the potential to manipulate elections, and their wielded power may inadvertently diverge from the collective will of the community.</p></li>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span lang="zh-hans">规则二</span><span lang="en">Rule 2</span></h3>

<p lang="zh-hans">基层层块以自由组合形成。</p>
<p lang="en">The blocks of the base layer are formed in free combinations.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">a) 自由组合的含义，一是加入哪个层块不是强制划分而由当事人选择；二是需要被选择的层块同意才能加入；三是可以随时退出所在层块。</p>
	<p lang="en">a) The meaning of free combination, first, the choice of joining a specific layer block is not mandatory and is left to the discretion of the individual; Second, consent from the layer block being chosen to join is required; The third is that one can exit the layer block at any time.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">b) 基层层块是递进自组织的主体，是要进行求和的个人意志向量之所在。保证基层层块向量求和的真实，基层以上的向量求和才有真实的基础。基层以上的层块只是求和结构，是逐层聚合的向量分和，功用是凝聚和体现基层的向量和。</p></li>
    <li><p lang="en">b) The grassroots layer block is the core of recursive self-organization, where the vector of individual will to be summed. To ensure the authenticity of the summation of vectors at the grassroots layer, the summation of vectors above the grassroots layer must have a genuine foundation. Layers above the grassroots layer are only summation structures, involving the incremental aggregation of vector components. Their function is to consolidate and reflect the vectors and essence of the grassroots layer.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">c) 递进自组织的前提在于基层层块必须是真正的自组织，因而不能有任何强制，必须自由组合。</p>
	<p lang="en">c) The premise of recursive self-organization is that the grassroots layer blocks must be truly self-organizing, so that there is no coercion and they can be freely combined.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">d) 自由组合让有认同的人组合在一起，可自由退出能避免不可调和的分歧或形成无法化解的僵局，也避免当选者被互不妥协的选举者向两端撕扯。</p>
	<p lang="en">d) Freedom of association allows people who identify with each other to come together. The ability to leave freely helps to avoid irreconcilable differences or the formation of unresolved deadlocks. It also prevents elected representatives from being torn apart on both ends by electoral participants who refuse to compromise.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">e) 自由组合可以使少数派形成自己的层块，避免少数混杂于多数被淹没，有利于保持少数派的特质。少数派的意志通过自己的“和载体”带入上级层块进行求和。</p>
	<p lang="en">e) The freedom of association allows minority groups to form their own layer blocks, preventing them from being assimilated and overwhelmed by the majority. This is beneficial for preserving the distinct characteristics of minority groups. The will of the minority is summed up in higher-level layer block through their own "sum carriers".</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">f) 目前的公权组织是按地域区划形成。其最小区划（如行政村或城镇的居民委员会）内的人口数量，也需进一步分为多个层块才能充分直接沟通。因此不需要打破公权组织的既有区划，只需在进一步分层块时自由组合，有利于与现实状态的契合及转型平顺。</p>
	<p lang="en">f) Currently, public power organization are organized based on geographical divisions. The population within the smallest administrative units, such as residents' committees in administrative villages or urban areas, also needs to be further subdivided into multiple layers to facilitate sufficiently direct communication. Therefore, there is no need to dismantle the existing geographical divisions of public power organization. Instead, the focus should be on freely combining during further subdivision into layers. This approach aligns well with the current state of affairs and facilitates a smooth transition.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">g) 如果确有需要突破地域区划的自由组合，在实行了递进自组织后，由相关区划的公权组织进行协商决定。</p>
	<p lang="en">g) If there is a need to break through the free association of geographical divisions, after the implementation of recursive self-organization, the public power organization of the relevant division shall negotiate and decide.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span lang="zh-hans">规则三</span><span lang="en">Rule 3</span></h3>

<p lang="zh-hans">每个层块以三分之二多数票权选举与决策；以二分之一多数票权否决。每个成员的票权为其下属所有层块的成员数。当选者的票权为其选举者票权的平均数。</p>
<p lang="en">Each layer block uses a two-thirds majority vote for elections and decision-making, and a simple majority vote for vetoing. The voting weight of each member is determined by the total number of members in all the layer blocks subordinate to them. The voting weight of an elected representative is the average of the voting weights of their electors.</p>
<ul>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">a) 采取三分之二决，是在一致性的价值理念和现实操作性之间的折中。一方面要求绝对多数，以避免二分之一的简单多数造成共同体近于势均力敌的分裂，一方面仍保留一定的少数服从多数，避免僵局无法化解。</p>
	<p lang="en">a) Adopting a two-thirds majority decision represents a compromise between the value of consensus and practical operability. On one hand, it demands an absolute majority to avoid the potential division caused by a simple majority, where the community might become nearly evenly split. On the other hand, it still maintains a degree of minority acceptance of the majority to prevent deadlock and ensure resolutions can be reached.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">b) 三分之二决固然不如二分之一决容易达成，但宁可不厌其烦反复协商。操作便捷只是其次。比起二分之一决，三分之二决更能促使共同体认真对待反对意见，有利培育整体共识。</p>
	<p lang="en">b) While a two-thirds decision may not be as easily attainable as a simple majority decision, it is preferable to endure the inconvenience of repeated negotiations. Operational convenience takes a back seat in importance. Compared to a simple majority decision, a two-thirds majority is more effective in prompting the community to genuinely consider opposing views, thereby fostering a more robust overall consensus.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">c) 递进自组织需要正式表决的情况不多。日常决策是由当选者以默契方式追随共同体意志进行，只有要事才需层块讨论，争执不下时才用计票表决；对当选者的重新选举也要计票表决。这些表决都事关全局，即使不能取得全体一致，至少需要三分之二支持。</p>
	<p lang="en">c) In the context of recursive self-organization, formal voting is infrequent. Daily decisions are made through an tacit understanding to the collective will by elected representative. Layer block discussions are reserved for crucial matters, with a vote tally used only in cases of unresolved disputes. Re-election of elected representatives also requires a vote tally. These votes are crucial in nature, and even if unanimous agreement cannot be reached, at least a two-thirds majority support is deemed necessary.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">d) 不必规定哪些事需要表决。除了选举和共同体约定表决之事，任何事项只要有人提议表决并获得规定之附议人数，即要表决。</p>
	<p lang="en">d) No need to specify which matters require a vote. Aside from elections and issues designated for communal agreement, any matter can be subject to a vote if someone proposes it and obtains the required seconding support as per the established criteria.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">e) 因为自由组合，基层层块一般不会陷入僵局（否则会重新组合）。而上级层块成员皆是“和载体”，不以个人意气行事，而是要为其承载的向量和（当选层块的意志）进行理性协商和寻求妥协。如果是对总体有益之事，总是可以找到共赢方案。若无论如何不能达成妥协，便说明应该放弃，或者暂时搁置。</p>
	<p lang="en">e) Due to the freedom of association, grassroots layers typically avoid deadlock (as they can reorganize if needed). Members of higher-level layers act as "sum carriers," working not on personal whims but engaging in rational negotiations and seeking compromises for the vectors they carry (the will of the elected layers). If an issue is beneficial to the overall community, mutually beneficial solutions can usually be found. If no compromise can be reached, it means that it may be necessary to abandon the issue or temporarily set it aside.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">f) 层块成员超过二分之一票权否决，该事项即需终止，以此制约当选人的日常决策或任命；或者当决策在实施过程中发现事与愿违时能够修正。</p>
	<p lang="en">f) If more than half of the members of a layer veto a decision, the matter must be terminated. This serves as a constraint on the daily decisions or appointments made by elected representatives. It also allows for corrections to be made during the implementation of decisions if they deviate from the intended course.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">g) 票权按下属成员数计，以使大小有别的层块权利公平。递进自组织结构中的每个当选人不仅代表其当选层块，同时代表其当选层块之下的所有下级层块。举例说，乡长在县委员会的票权，不是选举其的村长数，而是其所在乡的选民总数。</p></li>
    <li><p lang="en">g) Voting rights are calculated based on the number of subordinate members to ensure a fair distribution of rights among layers of different sizes within the recursive self-organizing structure. Each elected representative in the recursive self-organizing structure represents not only their elected layer but also all the subordinate layers beneath it. For example, the voting power of a township mayor in the county committee is not determined by the number of village mayors who elected them but by the total number of voters in the township they represent.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">h) 达到足够比例的票权附议，相应层块就需组织下属成员进行公决。公决结果达到二分之一票权，否决生效。</p>
	<p lang="en">h) Upon reaching a sufficient proportion of supporting votes, the corresponding layer must organize its subordinate members for a public referendum. If the public referendum results in a simple majority vote, the veto becomes effective.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">i) 当选者除了不参加本层块的重新选举，对层块的其他表决都要参与。这有利于其参与上级层块立法决策时，能够充分表达本层块的意愿，避免上下层块出现冲突。其之所以当选，说明其在本层块相对出众；作为行政者操作层块事务，有全局视角；加上其超脱下属各层块，地位中立，因此当选者在本层块的表决中应具有相应分量。由于当选者没有下属层块（规则四规定“不可兼有其他层块的当选身份”）其个人一票无法在表决中发挥应有作用，故给其本层块选举者票权的平均数作为其票权，使其能在层块表决中有效地参与，以及发挥仲裁及打破僵局的作用。</p></li>
    <li><p lang="en">i) The elected representative, apart from abstaining from reelection within their own layer block, is required to participate in all other layer decisions. This ensures their involvement in legislative decisions at higher layers, allowing them to fully express the intentions of their own layer and avoid conflicts between layers. The reason for their election indicates their relative excellence within the layer. As administrators overseeing layer affairs, they possess a global perspective. Furthermore, their position detached from subordinate layers, coupled with their neutral status, implies that elected representatives should carry a corresponding voting power in layer decisions. Since elected representatives do not have subordinate layers (as stated in Rule Four: "Cannot concurrently hold elected status in other layers"), their personal vote may not have the intended impact in decisions. Therefore, their voting power is determined by the average voting power of their electors within their own layer. This approach enables them to effectively participate in layer decisions, serving an arbitration and deadlock-breaking role when needed.</p></li>

<p lang="en">The elected representative of a layer block becomes the elector for the upper-level layer block. There are no term limits for elected representatives, and elections can be held at any time. An incumbent elected representative may not belong to any lower layer block, may not hold elected positions in other layer blocks, and is also ineligible to participate in the elections of the current layer block.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">a) 由当选者作为上一级层块的选举者，即“逐层递选”。</p>
	<p lang="en">a) Where the elected representatives serve as electors for the layer above them, it is known as "recursive elections".</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">b) 选举可随时举行，当选者无任期限制，可长期在位，也可被随时选举罢免。</p>
	<p lang="en">(b) Elections may be held at any time, and those elected representative may remain in office for a long time or may be recalled at any time by election.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">c) 为了保证当选者地位中立，履责公平，当选者不得属于下属任何层块，因此当选者原本所属层块若在其当选的层块覆盖之下，当选者须与之脱离。</p>
	<p lang="en">c) To ensure the neutrality of elected representatives and fair execution of their responsibilities, elected representatives must not belong to any subordinate layer. Therefore, if the layer to which the elected representative originally belonged falls under the jurisdiction of the layer they were elected to, the elected representative must disassociate from the original layer.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">d) 当选者不得兼有其他层块的当选身份，也是为防止利益冲突而失公允。同一人若在不同层块当选，则只能接受一个当选身份，放弃其他，所以当选者在其当选层块内是没有下属层块的。</p></li>
    <li><p lang="en">d) Elected representatives are prohibited from holding elected positions in multiple layers, aiming to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain fairness. If an representative is elected in different layers, they can only accept one elected position, relinquishing others. Consequently, elected individuals within their elected layer do not have subordinate layers.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">e) 规定在位当选者不参加本层块选举，是因为选举要决定的正是更换当选者本人与否，只需其等待并接受结果。</p></li>

In this case, the elected representative simply needs to wait and accept the outcome.</p></li>

    <li><p lang="en">f) The rules do not stipulate that elected representatives must come from the layer conducting the election; anyone can be elected as the elected representative within the layer.

	<p lang="en">a) In Figure 17, "appointment" pertains to the administrative team assisting the "sum carrier" (administrative head). The administrative team fundamentally serves as a tool to execute the responsibilities of the administrative head, with authority delegated by the administrative head. The tool must obey; disobedience results in reappointment.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">b) “受托人”是指得到行政首长任命或授权者。规模较大的行政团队，行政首长无法任命所有职位，可由受托人逐层向下任命，如元首任命部长，部长任命其下属司长，司长任命下属处长……</p>
	<p lang="en">b) "Trustee" means a person appointed or authorized by the executive head. For a larger administrative team, the head of the executive cannot appoint all positions, but can be appointed by the trustee down the levels, such as the head of state appointing the minister, the minister appointing his subordinate director, the director appointing the subordinate director...</p></li>

	<p lang="en">In the diagram, the large triangle encompasses smaller triangles, representing the nested relationships of autonomous entities. To simplify, only three layers are depicted, and each triangle includes only two of its subordinate triangles. Recursive self-organization is a structure where entities are nested layer by layer, ultimately forming a large triangle that encompasses all layers. Each triangle represents an autonomous entity. For example, 1 and 1' are the first-level blocks at the grassroots. '...' represents other same-level blocks that are not drawn. Assuming 1...1' represents village groups and 2...2' represents administrative villages. Initially, each village group is an autonomous entity, managing internal affairs collectively decided by its members and the elected village group leader—such as how to collaborate, formulate rules, and implement rewards and penalties. Simultaneously, the administrative village is a larger autonomous entity that includes village groups. Internal affairs—collaboration among village groups, coordination of relationships, establishment of rules, distribution of interests, etc.—are decided and managed by the leaders of each village group and the elected head of the village committee. The entities 2...2' collectively form the autonomous entity X at the township level, encompassing various administrative villages and the two-layer autonomous entities of village groups within each village. X can be at any hierarchical level, and so on. The nested autonomous entities expand layer by layer in this manner.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">b) 这种自治从基层层块开始，自下而上的所有层块皆为自治体。但不管相隔多少层，只要被包括在同一个三角内，自治便被限定于“不与上级决策和法律违反”。这里的“上级”指自治体被嵌套于其中的所有三角。</p>
	<p lang="en">b) This autonomy starts at the grassroots level, and all the layers from the bottom up are self-government. But no matter how many layers are separated, as long as they are included in the same triangle, autonomy is limited to "not violating decisions and laws with superiors". The "superior" here refers to all the triangles in which the autonomous government is nested.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">c) 服从与自治不构成矛盾，没有服从是有自而无治。但这与自上而下的层层统治有何区别？在传统概念中，上级与下级相互为“他者”关系，管束甚至压制，与自治不相容。在递进自组织中，上级产生于下级的向量求和，每个下级层块的意志都参与向量求和，最终结果虽不会和任何下级层块的意志完全一致，却是所有下级层块的共同意志，人人有份。在这个意义上，服从上级法律和决策正是服从自己，是自身意志在更高层次的扩展与升华。</p>
	<p lang="en">c) Obedience and self-government are not contradictory, and without obedience there is no self-governance. But how does this differ from top-down layered rule? In the traditional concept, superiors and subordinates are in a relationship of "otherness", which is incompatible with autonomy. In recursive self-organization, the superior generates the vector summation of the subordinate, and the will of each subordinate layer participates in the vector summation, although the final result will not be completely consistent with the will of any subordinate layer, but it is the collective will of all subordinate layers, and everyone has a share. In this sense, obedience to the laws and decisions of superiors is to obey oneself, and it is the expansion and sublimation of one's own will at a higher level.</p></li>
    <li><p lang="zh-hans">d) 既然递进自组织的立法权是自下而上的，同时又要求下级法律服从上级法律，这两种关系的并存，会导致下级一定尽量少立上级之法，以免限制自身的自治和自由。除非对下级利益十分必要的立法才让渡给上级，否则下级就不会授权上级立法。如同专制不愿权力下交一样，递进自组织照样不愿权力上交，尽可能保持自己做主。层层如此，导致下级的自主空间保持在最大。</p>
	<p lang="en">d) Since the recursive self-organization legislative power is from bottom-up, and at the same time requires the subordinate laws to be subordinate to the higher laws, the coexistence of these two relations will lead to the fact that the subordinates must make as few laws as possible from the superiors, so as not to limit their own autonomy and freedom. Unless legislation is necessary for the interests of the subordinate is ceded to the superior, the subordinate will not authorize the higher legislature. Just as autocracy is reluctant to hand over power, recursive self-organization is reluctant to hand over power and remains in charge as much as possible. This is done layer by layer, resulting in the autonomy of the subordinates being kept to the maximum.</p>
	<p lang="zh-hans">e) 以往所说的自治是从统治结构分出一块，给其较多独立性与自决权，其内部仍是统治，自治只是“自己统治”，是精英独享的自治。而真正的自治应是全民的，即从每个社会成员个人开始，所有层次所有层块皆自治，个人意志、集体意志、社会意志都得到体现——只有递进自组织能做到这种全民自治。</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">递进自组织实施于公权组织虽是前所未有的革命，社会却不会“翻天覆地”，大致会与当今的自由民主社会相似——有人权、法治、自由经济，有言论出版、结社组党、宗教信仰的自由；示威集会、社会运动都可进行，众权组织和私权组织有充分的自治空间。普通民众直接感受的只是公权力选举的变化——代议制社会的民众可能会在心理上认为有退步（不再直接选举高层职位），但实际境况不会变差，长期发展会更好；专制社会的民众则会当作进步，实际境况也得到改善。</p>
<p lang="en">The implementation of recursive self-organization in public power organizations is an unprecedented revolution, yet it won't result in a "earth-shattering" transformation. In essence, it will be somewhat similar to contemporary liberal democratic societies — with human rights, rule of law, a free economy, freedom of speech and the press, association and party formation, as well as freedom of religion. The right to protest and engage in social movements will still exist, and both public and private organizations will have ample autonomy. The direct experience for ordinary citizens will mainly involve changes in the election of public authorities — in representative democracies, there might be a perceived psychological regression (due to the absence of direct elections for high-level positions), but the actual situation will not worsen, and long-term development is likely to improve. In authoritarian societies, citizens may perceive it as progress, and the actual situation is likely to improve as well.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">下面对实施上述规则将导致的社会变化做一些展望，并非是定论，只是帮助想象和理解递进自组织社会。</p>
<p lang="en">The following provides some prospects for the social changes that would result from implementing the above rules. It is not a definitive conclusion but rather aims to assist in envisioning and understanding a society with recursive self-organization.</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span lang="zh-hans">政体</span><span lang="en">political system</span></h3>

<p lang="zh-hans">首先的问题是有无政府？从政府的定义——于某个区域订立、执行法律和管理的、由相应机构组成的一套政治体系——而言，递进自组织社会当然有政府。但是其政府由全民组成，或者说囊括了全体社会成员的递进自组织本身即是政府——在这层意义上，又和无政府主义的分散管理和大众参与之理念有某种契合。</p>
<p lang="en">The primary question is whether there is a government. From the definition of government—a political system established in a certain region, responsible for enacting and enforcing laws, and composed of relevant institutions—in the context of a recursive self-organizing society, there is indeed a government. However, its government is composed of the entire populace, or one could say that the recursive self-organization itself, encompassing all members of society, serves as the government. In this sense, there is a certain alignment with the decentralized management and mass participation principles of anarchism.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">递进自组织的政体是“逐层递选制+递进委员会制”——每个层块都是一个自治委员会，由层块所有成员构成，决定本层块的大政方针，进行选举；当选者是本层块行政首长，执行委员会所制定的大政方针；同时当选者作为“和载体”成为上级委员会（层块）的成员，与其他成员共同决定上级层块的大政方针，选举上级层块行政首长……如此递进，层层向上，直至覆盖整个社会。</p>
<p lang="en">The political system of recursive self-organization follows a "recursive election system + recursive committee system." Each layer functions as an autonomous committee composed of all its members, deciding on the major political directions for the layer and conducting elections. The elected individual becomes the administrative head of the layer, implementing the major political directions established by the committee. Simultaneously, as the elected individual acts as the "sum carrier," they become a member of the higher-level committee (layer) and, along with other members, collectively decides on the major political directions of the higher-level layer, elects the administrative head of the higher-level layer, and so on. This progression continues upward, covering each layer until it encompasses the entire society.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">以往委员会的称呼被滥用。真正的委员会首先要保证每个委员都能充分交流和表达，所有成员的发言权和决策权完全平等，避免主持人控制，因此委员会的规模只能在可充分直接沟通的经验范围内。当社会的公权组织是全民自下而上形成的递进委员会系统，政府是由全民参与的，每个委员会主任将不是以其个人意志，而是以其承载的共同体意志在上级委员会进行向量求和，既考虑让本共同体得到最大利益，也要与其他委员（代表各自共同体）进行妥协。</p>
<p lang="en">The term "committee" has been misused in the past. A genuine committee must first ensure that each member can sufficiently communicate and express themselves, with all members having equal rights to speak and make decisions, avoiding control by a facilitator. Therefore, the size of the committee can only be within the range where sufficient direct communication is feasible. When the public organizations of society form a recursive committee system from the bottom-up, with government being participatory across the entire populace, each committee director will not act based on their personal will but will sum up the vector in the higher-level committee based on the collective will they carry. This involves considering the maximum benefit for their community while also compromising with other committee directors (representing their respective communities).</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">委员会不像大规模表决那样面对孤立问题进行单次投票，而是面对系列问题的长期合作。委员会决策往往能一致通过，正在于充分综合了各方意见。因为每次要解决的问题不同，委员会不会形成不变的多数派和少数派。各方都可以期望这次让步会在下次换取对方让步，从而形成长期交易机制。少数服从多数的表决只是为了打破僵局偶尔为之，成为常规就意味委员会失效。</p>
<p lang="en">A committee, unlike large-scale voting facing isolated issues in a single vote, engages in long-term cooperation addressing a series of problems. Committee decisions often achieve consensus by fully incorporating various perspectives. Because the issues to be addressed vary each time, a committee does not form a fixed majority and minority. All parties can anticipate that concessions made in one instance will be reciprocated in the next, forming a long-term transactional mechanism. Majority rule, where the minority yields to the majority, is occasionally employed to break a deadlock, but if it becomes routine, it signifies the committee's ineffectiveness.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">之所以代议制需要竞选，是因为大规模群体中的选举者没有其他方法了解参选人，竞选是参选人与选举人之间的沟通方式。在经验范围，选举人了解参选人，也能随时与其充分沟通，竞选便不再需要。代议制中，想赢得选举需要动员选民，运用媒体，进行宣传，策划公关，由此带来的筹措资金、吸纳人才、调查研究等都非个人可为，必须依靠政党。而经验范围的选举者和被选举者互相了解，层块内选举方便，因此递进自组织社会虽不禁止组党，政党却不再与掌权有关。</p>
<p lang="en">The reason representative democracy requires campaigns is that, within large-scale communities, electors have no other means to learn about candidates, and campaigning serves as the communication method between candidates and electors. Within the empirical range, electors can know the candidates and communicate with them fully at any time, rendering campaigning unnecessary. In representative democracy, winning an election requires mobilizing voters, utilizing media for publicity, planning public relations, and the resulting fundraising, talent recruitment, research, etc., are beyond an individual's capacity and must rely on political parties. In the empirical range, mutual understanding between electors and candidates is feasible, making elections within layers convenient. Therefore, while recursive self-organizing societies do not prohibit party formation, political parties are no longer linked to wielding power.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">每个当选的“和载体”并非机械地承载已求出的向量和，只进行被动代表或传递，反而选举“和载体”就是为了利用其“默契”主动完成大部分日常决策，其他成员只参与大政方针。这必然要求“和载体”具有独立性，有准确把握共同体意志的智慧，并以主动决策和领导使之实现；也要求“和载体”进入上级层块后不是被动执行指令，而是主动与其他“和载体”协商、交易、妥协，其被赋予的自主空间并不小于代议制的“代议士”。但那并非是给其的权力，而是其须尽的义务。</p>
<p lang="en">Each elected "sum carrier" does not mechanically carry the already determined vector and only passively represents or conveys it. Instead, the election of a "sum carrier" is for the purpose of utilizing their "tacit understanding" to actively handle the majority of daily decisions, with other members participating primarily in major political directions. This inevitably requires the "sum carrier" to possess independence, the wisdom to accurately grasp the collective will, and the ability to actively make decisions and lead its implementation. It also demands that, upon entering a higher-level layer, the "sum carrier" is not passively executing orders but actively engaging in negotiations, transactions, and compromises with other "sum carriers." The autonomous space granted to it is no smaller than the "representative" in a representative democracy. However, this is not a bestowed power but rather an obligation that it must fulfill.</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span lang="zh-hans">参与</span><span lang="en">Participation</span></h3>

<ul>
<li><p lang="zh-hans">a) <b>低成本参与：</b>对于全民参与社会管理的质疑，往往集中于人们是否有这种意愿。远非所有人都热衷于公共事务，哪怕与自己有着非常直接的关系，许多人也漠不关心，因此才需要政客代议，甚至连选举政客都懒得参与。其实，获得承认、进行分享、追求理想等公益心人人皆有，只是很大程度取决于需付出的成本。如果参与成本低于分享愿望，便会改变冷漠。递进自组织的基层民主本身成本就不高，所有成员的共同参与使成本进一步分摊。且多数日常事务并不需要全体成员进行实际协商，而是由“和载体”在头脑中模拟，更使参与成本降低。</p>
<p lang="en">a) Low-cost Participation: Skepticism about widespread participation in social management often centers around whether people have the willingness to engage. Not everyone is enthusiastic about public affairs, even if it directly relates to them; many people remain indifferent. Hence, politicians are needed for representation, and some may even refrain from participating in electing politicians. In reality, everyone has altruistic tendencies such as seeking recognition, sharing, and pursuing ideals, but this largely depends on the associated costs. If the cost of participation is lower than the desire to share, it can change indifference. Grassroots democracy in recursive self-organization itself incurs relatively low costs, with the collective involvement of all members further spreading the costs. Additionally, most daily affairs do not require actual negotiation by all members; instead, the "sum carrier" simulates them in their mind, reducing the cost of participation even more.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">以往人们不参与公共事务的另一原因是在大规模群体中可以搭便车。而在递进自组织的经验范围，搭便车无所遁形，从而失去熟人群体的尊重，从而不再是最优选择。</p>
<p lang="en">Another reason people did not participate in public affairs in the past is that they could free-ride in large groups. However, within the scope of recursive self-organization, free-riding is not easily concealed, resulting in a loss of respect within familiar groups, making it no longer the optimal choice.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">是否积极参与公共事务的问题，只需要解决递进自组织的基层层块，其他层块皆为“和载体”，根本不允许存在这个问题。“和载体”之所以能当选，对其的基本要求就是积极参与公共事务，且受到经验范围的选举者时刻监督。</p>
<p lang="en">The question of whether to actively participate in public affairs only needs to be addressed at the grassroots level of recursive self-organization; all other levels consist of "sum carriers," and this issue is fundamentally not allowed to exist. The basic requirement for "sum carriers" to be elected is their active participation in public affairs, and they are constantly supervised by the voters within the empirical range.</p></li>

<li><p lang="zh-hans">b) <b>开放参与：</b>众权组织自行决定组织方式，若认为没有必要和公权组织发生联系，可以只做独立的社会团体；但是其自身若实行递进自组织，便可以被纳入公权组织。所谓的纳入，即是该众权组织推选的“和载体”被相应的公权组织层块接纳为成员，参加公权组织的决策，进行该层块的选举。其参与表决的票权，是该众权组织的成员数。</p>
<p lang="en">b) Open participation: The collective power organizations determines its own way of organizing. If it deems unnecessary to establish a connection with public power organization, it can choose to operate as an independent societal group. However, if it implements recursive self-organization, it can be integrated into public power organization. The integration involves the "sum carrier" elected by the collective power organizations being accepted as a member by the corresponding public power organization layer, participating in the decision-making of the public power organization, and engaging in the elections of that layer. The voting rights in the decision-making process are based on the number of members in the collective power organizations.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">这会吸引一些众权组织实行递进自组织，以获得被纳入公权组织的资格，从而对公权力发生影响，有利于自身发展和宗旨的实现。众权组织在代议制下只能通过局外制造压力影响公权力，有无作用取决于公权力接受与否。在递进自组织社会，众权组织通过纳入公权组织可以直接参与公共决策，自行发挥作用。</p>
<p lang="en">This will attract some collective power organizations to implement recursive self-organization in order to qualify for integration into public power organization, thereby influencing public power and benefiting their own development and goals. In a representative democracy, collective power organizations can only influence public power by exerting pressure from the outside, and their effectiveness depends on whether public authorities accept it. In a recursive self-organizing society, collective power organizations can directly participate in public decision-making by integrating into public authorities and play an active role.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">私权组织是所有者的个人领地，不实行递进自组织。私权组织的雇员可以建立自己的众权组织（如工会或监督机构），若实行递进自组织，也能纳入公权组织。对公权组织而言，私权组织的老板与雇员的权利等同，因为雇员的人数多，总体影响力便比老板更大，公权组织的决策因此会向雇员倾斜。同时，递进自组织的逐层提炼理性可以避免民粹主义，既抑制私权组织的恶，也保留其对社会有利的一面。</p>
<p lang="en">The private organization is the personal domain of the owner, and does not practice recursive self-organization. Employees of private organizations may establish their own collective power organizations (such as trade unions or supervisory bodies) and, if they are recursively self-organized, may also be included in public power organizations. For public power organizations, the rights of the boss of the private organization are the same as those of the employees, because the larger the number of employees, the greater the overall influence of the boss, and therefore the decision-making of the public organization will be tilted in favor of the employees. At the same time, recursive self-organization can avoid populism, suppress the evil of private organizations, and retain their socially beneficial aspects.</p></li>

<p lang="en">c) Multi-dimensional participation: In traditional societies, the workplace and residence were often in the same location. In modern society, most people's workplaces and residences are separate. Restricting citizens to participate only in a single region is evidently inappropriate. Citizens should have the option to participate in both the public power organization of their place of residence and their workplace. Additionally, they can bring their personal opinions from various domains into public power organizations through participation in collective power organizations, thereby contributing to decisions made by public power organization through different channels.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">现实中经常看得到积极者占优势的情况，递进自组织是否会在积极者与消极者之间形成实际的不平等？在无法充分直接沟通的人群中，外在表达发挥主要作用，积极者因此可以脱颖而出。但是人皆有看法和反应，积极或消极只是外在表达的不同。在能够充分直接沟通的范围，外在表达不是决定性的，消极者通过其他方式（表情神态、肢体语言、行事方式等）一样能够表达，并被其他成员准确感知（通过默契），因此积极者和消极者的优势差别不会那么大。</p>
<p lang="en">In reality, we often see situations where active individuals have an advantage. Will recursive self-organization lead to actual inequality between the active and passive participants? In crowds where direct communication is not sufficient, external expression plays a major role, allowing active individuals to stand out. However, everyone has opinions and reactions, and being active or passive is just a difference in external expression. In a range where direct communication is sufficient, external expression is not decisive. Passive participants can convey their sentiments through other means (facial expressions, body language, actions, etc.) and be accurately perceived by other members (through mutual understanding), so the advantage difference between active and passive participants may not be significant.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">也不会因为人参与项目的多少而导致影响力不平等。因为每个项目只解决相关项目的事，选举的只是项目的“和载体”，不涉及项目之外的其他事。积极者参与的项目数量多，只相当于其分别表达了针对不同事项的个别意志。其参与工会递进自组织表达的意志，与其参与环保递进自组织表达的意志，即使都被纳入到公权组织中，却不等同于数量求和中的一人投两票，对向量求和仍然是“1”，只是更多面和立体。消极者参与项目少，是因为不看重其他方面，只要在看重的方面与他人影响力一样，对其就够了。</p>
<p lang="en">Nor will the influence be unequal due to the number of projects people participate in. Each project addresses only relevant matters, and the election is for the "carrier" of the project, not involving other matters outside the project. The active participant's involvement in multiple projects is equivalent to expressing individual will on different issues. Whether expressing intentions through participating in a union's recursive self-organization or environmental protection's recursive self-organization, even if both are integrated into public organizations, it does not equate to one person having two votes in quantity; the vector sum is still "1," just with more facets and depth. Passive participants engage in fewer projects because they prioritize certain aspects, and as long as their influence is equal to others in those areas, it suffices for them.</p></li>

<li><p lang="zh-hans">d) <b>宏观参与：</b>如果民众只关注选举总统、议员，听起来大，实际参与却很低——每隔几年才有几分钟投票。而在递进自组织的基层，普通民众时刻参与公权力运作，像滴水汇成河那样延伸到公权力的最高层块。</p>
<p lang="en">d) Macro participation: If the public only focuses on electing the president and legislators, it may sound significant, but the actual participation is very low—just a few minutes of voting every few years. In the grassroots of recursive self-organization, ordinary people are constantly involved in the operation of public power, extending upward to the highest layer block of public power like drops of water converging into a river.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">但是现代科技让基层成员能够放眼世界，对宏观议题的各种看法似乎非得选举总统或议员才能对等，单靠递进自组织的基层参与无法满足。这是递进自组织不如代议制之处，却是必要的不如，是递进自组织与代议制的基本区别所在。</p>
<p lang="en">However, modern technology allows grassroots members to have a global perspective, and various opinions on macro issues seem to require an equivalent platform like electing a president or legislator; relying solely on grassroots participation in recursive self-organization may not be sufficient. This is a limitation of recursive self-organization compared to representative democracy, but it is a necessary limitation and a fundamental difference between recursive self-organization and representative democracy.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">平民当然有权关注并参与层块之外的事务。虽然其在递进自组织的参与可通过“和载体”向上传递，但要经过好几道间接环节，不能让人直观地信服自己的意见已得到了表达。且人性总是宁愿直接行使权利而不要间接中转。对此，首先可以利用言论出版、结社组党、示威抗议等其他表达管道，对任何层次的事务进行批评、提出要求；其次可以通过串联动员，只要能获得相应范围二分之一成员的支持，根据递进自组织规则三，就能否决该范围最高层块的决策，包括选举结果— —相当于罢免该范围最高层块的当选人。这种直接罢免和代议制普选相比，门槛并不更高，却随时可以进行。</p>
<p lang="en">Of course, ordinary citizens have the right to focus on and participate in affairs beyond the layers. Although their participation in recursive self-organization can be conveyed through "sum carrier", it goes through several indirect channels, making it difficult for people to intuitively believe that their opinions have been effectively expressed. Moreover, human nature tends to exercise rights directly rather than through indirect intermediaries. To address this, firstly, other channels of expression, such as freedom of speech, association, and protests, can be utilized to criticize and make demands on affairs at any level. Secondly, through linkage and mobilization, as long as the support of half of the members within a corresponding scope is obtained, according to Rule 3 of recursive self-organization, decisions at the highest level within that scope, including election results, can be vetoed—equivalent to recalling the elected person at the highest level within that scope. This direct recall, compared to the general elections in representative systems, does not have a higher threshold and can be conducted at any time.</p></li>

<li><p lang="zh-hans">e) <b>精英参与：</b>“和载体”当然算政治精英。区别在于二元结构的政治精英与民众是分离的，精英主要追求个人利益；递进自组织的政治精英由逐层递选产生，只能作为“和载体”，与共同体意志出现任何偏离都会立刻受到制约。</p>
<p lang="en">e) Elite participation: "sum carrier" are, of course, political elites. The difference is that the political elite is separated from the masses in a dualistic structure, with the elite mainly pursuing personal interests; The recursive self-organization political elite is elected layer by layer, and can only serve as a "sum carrier", and any deviation from the will of the community will be immediately constrained.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">随时选举成为有效制约的前提，需要“和载体”的位置是被人追求的，罢免则是当选者力图避免的，制约才能成立。高层位置没有问题，自会成为众多有政治抱负者的竞争目标；县乡长一类位置也不会缺人，那除了是在逐层递选阶梯攀登的中间阶段，也是不错的职业。关键在于基层职位能否吸引足够的参选者，并在当选后受随时选举的制约？类似村民小组、业主小组的基层当选者，面对的皆是琐碎小事，却无荣耀和利益。而递进自组织随时选举的制约只要在基层无效，就等于失去源头和根基，导致整体无效。</p>
<p lang="en">Elections at any time become a prerequisite for effective checks, and the position of "sum carrier" is pursued, and recall is what the elected representative try to avoid, so that the constraints can be established. There is no problem with the top position, and it will become a competition target for many political aspirants; There will be no shortage of people in the position of county and township head, which is not only in the middle stage of climbing the ladder layer by layer, but also a good career. The key is whether the grassroots positions can attract enough candidates and be subject to elections at any time after they are elected. Grassroots elected people similar to villagers' groups and owners' groups face trivial matters, but there is no glory and interests. As long as the constraints of recursive self-organization elections at any time are ineffective at the grassroots level, it is equivalent to losing the source and foundation, resulting in the ineffectiveness of the whole.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">吸引基层当选者，主要不能靠物质激励。假设每家出一人，代表基本一致的家庭利益和诉求参与基层自由组合的层块，平均每个层块十家（三、四十人），涵盖中国人口就得有三、四千万个这种基层层块。若用金钱激励这一层当选者，少则不起作用（甚至是反作用），多则难以负担。事实上，这层当选者需要的条件不高，多数人都能承担，不会缺了谁就不行。当选者的主要动力应是公益心。自由组合多为亲朋好友或共识同道，能当选说明受到大家推戴和信任，已是激励，论金钱反而失去这个意义，反会削弱人的动力（美国心理学家 Edward Deci 以实验证实诸如报酬等外在动机对内在动机具有“驱逐效应”）。何况需要基层当选者做的事不多，顺手即可完成，一般无需耽误个人主业。其所做的服务与层块成员关系紧密，会被看到并感激，也会按人情往来予以回报。这些因素的综合，是这层“和载体”的责任心基础，而遭到罢免在亲友同道中丢的颜面，则能起到约束其追随层块意志的作用。</p>
<p lang="en">Attracting grassroots elected representatives cannot rely primarily on material incentives. Assuming each household contributes one representative, representing the basic consistent interests and demands of families participating in the freely formed blocks at the grassroots level, with an average of ten households per block (thirty to forty people), there would be tens of millions of such grassroots blocks covering the Chinese population. If monetary incentives are used for these elected representatives, it may have little effect, or even backfire, if the amounts are small, and it would be difficult to afford if the amounts are large. In fact, the conditions required for these elected representatives are not high, and most people can afford them; there is no indispensable need for any specific individual. The main motivation for these elected representatives should be a sense of public service. <br/><br/>

Freely formed blocks often consist of relatives, friends, or like-minded individuals, and being elected indicates the collective endorsement and trust of the group, serving as motivation in itself. Offering monetary rewards may diminish intrinsic motivation, as demonstrated by the "crowding-out effect" observed in studies, such as those conducted by the American psychologist Edward Deci on external motivators like rewards. Moreover, the tasks required of grassroots elected representatives are usually minimal and can be easily accomplished without significantly interfering with personal occupations. The services they provide are closely tied to the relationships with block members, and their efforts are visible and appreciated, often reciprocated based on personal relationships. The combination of these factors forms the foundation of the "sum carrier" sense of responsibility, and the potential loss of face within their circle of friends and associates in the event of a recall can act as a constraint on following the will of the block.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">基层“和载体”的位置没那么吸引人，其实有利于避免激发类似动物群争夺首领的那种竞争，容易使参选者和当选者保持理性。不特别在意当选，就不会明知不对也要为选票迎合，而会更多考虑全局和长远，坚持自己认为正确的想法，并去说服层块其他成员，对基层意志的形成起到引导作用，从而更会符合层块的整体利益。而选举人也不会对当选人有极端要求和压力，这相当于在源头就对民粹主义进行了缓冲。</p>
<p lang="en">The position of grassroots "sum carrier" is not as appealing, which actually helps prevent the kind of competition seen in animal groups vying for leadership, making it easier for candidates and elected representatives to maintain rationality. If one is not particularly concerned about being elected, there is no incentive to compromise principles for votes. Instead, candidates are more likely to consider the overall picture and long-term goals, sticking to their own convictions and trying to persuade other members of the block. This guides the formation of grassroots will and aligns more with the overall interests of the block. In this way, elected representatives are more likely to act in a manner that benefits the block as a whole. Additionally, electors are less likely to impose extreme demands and pressure on the elected representatives, providing a buffer against populism right from the source.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">只要基层“和载体”是真实的，递进自组织便有了保证，往上的层级只是不断求和成更大向量和的过程。越往上的“和载体”工作量越大，要如何激励，给什么利益，给多少，怎么给，递进自组织的机制会“自生自发”地兼顾各个方面进行调节。</p>
<p lang="en">As long as the grassroots "sum carrier" are genuine, there is an assurance for the implementation of recursive self-organization. The higher-level positions are merely the process of continuously summing up into a larger vector. The higher the level of the "sum carrier", the greater the workload. How to motivate them, what benefits to provide, how much to give, and how to provide them—recursive self-organization's mechanism will spontaneously and organically adjust to address these various aspects.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">另外，递进自组织相当于给每个社会成员一视同仁地开放从基层上升到最高层的通路。只要本人有愿望，唯一取决的只是工作能力与尽职态度。如果一个人的综合素质总是超过同层块其他成员，就能在逐层递选的阶梯上不断被选到更高层块，没有其他障碍，一直达到其素质与职位的平衡点，即便那平衡点是国家元首。这种“条条大道通罗马”，可以产生类似科举制的激励，让从基层起步的有志者通过层层忠心服务不断攀登，社会亦实现人尽其才。</p>
<p lang="en">In addition, recursive self-organization is equivalent to providing an equal and open path for every member of society to ascend from the grassroots to the highest level. As long as an individual has the desire, the only determining factors are their work capacity and diligence. If a person's overall qualities consistently surpass those of other members at the same level, they can continuously be elected to higher levels on the ladder of recursive selection, without any other obstacles, until they reach a balance point between their qualities and the position— even if that balance point is the head of state. This "all roads lead to Rome" approach can create incentives similar to the imperial examination system, allowing those who start from the grassroots and have aspirations to climb through loyal service at each level, enabling society to fully utilize people's talents.</p></li>

<p lang="zh-hans">经验范围的逐层递选和随时选举是保证递进自组织的关键，其与代议制选举的主要区别也在此。如果让皇帝每隔几年才能任免一次大臣，都会认为不可思议。皇帝之所以能把权力贯彻到底，很大程度上正是在于其对官员任免是随时的。为何源自人民的权力就只能定期任免（选举）？甚至还要被认为合理呢？</p>
<p lang="en">The key to ensuring recursive self-organization lies in the recursive election from bottom up and elections at any time within empirical range, and this is the main difference from representative elections. If the emperor could only appoint or dismiss ministers every few years, it would be considered inconceivable. The reason why the emperor could exercise power thoroughly largely lies in the fact that he could appoint or dismiss officials at any time. Why should the power originating from the people only be subject to periodic appointments (elections)? And why is it considered reasonable?</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">代议制选举的规模巨大，每次都得大动干戈——竞选、登记选民、设立投票点、全民投票……成本高昂，劳民伤财，且须由专门机构主持，因此只能定期选举。那不是因为合理，是不得已。</p>
<p lang="en">Representative elections are of massive scale, requiring significant efforts each time—campaigning, voter registration, setting up polling stations, and nationwide voting. The costs are high, both in terms of resources and manpower. Moreover, these processes need to be overseen by specialized institutions, making periodic elections a necessity. That's not because it's reasonable, it's a last resort.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">列举定期选举的合理性，主要说的是固定任期可以给当选者缓冲空间，给代议士协商和妥协的自主权，以保持理性和长远利益的考量，免受民粹主义急功近利的裹挟。然而递进自组织已经能够更好地解决这种问题，无需靠定期选举，反而需要通过自发方便、成本低廉的随时选举，进一步保证权力意志不脱离共同体（社会）意志，使社会意志随时得到体现。</p>
<p lang="en">Enumerating the rationale behind periodic elections, it is often argued that fixed terms provide elected officials with a buffer space, granting autonomy for representatives to negotiate and compromise. This autonomy is seen as essential for maintaining rational decision-making and considering long-term interests, shielding against the influence of populist, short-sighted demands. However, the mechanism of recursive self-organization is already better equipped to address such issues. Instead of relying on periodic elections, it requires spontaneous and cost-effective elections at any time to ensure that the will of those in power remains aligned with the collective will of the community (society) and that societal decisions are reflected promptly.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">前面说过，“随时选举”的含而不发，导致当选者每次决策和履责前都会在头脑中进行“模拟选举”，确信得到多数赞同时才会实行，因此选举便无需发生。但是还有一种担心，递进结构的环环相扣会不会在下级当选人被更换时，导致上级当选人随之变化？的确，一个新当选的乡长可能会要求重选县长，但是其远达不到替换县长所要求的三分之二多数。除非原本要求重选县长的选举人只差一票就达到三分之二，或是那个县的多数乡镇同时换了新当选人，才能更换县长。前者说明县长已经应该更换，后者的概率很小，因此不必担心。</p>
<p lang="en">As mentioned earlier, the implicit nature of "anytime elections" results in elected officials mentally conducting a "simulated election" before making decisions or fulfilling responsibilities. They ensure majority approval in their minds before implementation, rendering the need for an actual election unnecessary. However, there is a concern that the interconnected nature of the recursive structure might lead to changes in upper-level elected officials when lower-level elected individuals are replaced. Indeed, a newly elected township leader may call for the re-election of the county leader, but they cannot meet the requirement of a two-thirds majority for the replacement of the county leader. This replacement would only occur if the original demand for the re-election of the county leader was only one vote short of a two-thirds majority, or if a majority of townships in that county simultaneously elected new leaders. The former scenario suggests that the county leader should indeed be replaced, and the latter scenario has a low probability of occurring, so there is no need for concern.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">不过，那位新当选的乡长如果调整了其承载的向量和，不会因为不能更换县长而导致完全无法体现。新乡长在县级层块中的种种参与，会尽力体现其新的调整，从而让调整按照应有的份额体现在县级层块的向量求和结果中。未被更换的县长在决策时，也会考虑新乡长需要的调整。类似疑问和细节还会有许多，在递进自组织的机制中都可以得到解决。</p>
<p lang="en">However, if the newly elected township leader adjusts the vector they carry, the inability to replace the county leader will not result in a complete inability to reflect the adjustments. The new township leader's various participation at the county level will strive to reflect their new adjustments, ensuring that the adjustments are appropriately reflected in the vector sum of the county-level block. The county leader who remains unchanged will also consider the adjustments needed by the new township leader when making decisions. There may be many similar questions and details, all of which can be addressed within the mechanisms of the recursive self-organization.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">递进自组织看上去只是一种简单方法，是否能实现权民合一那样的社会变革？不妨看一下有无竞选的简单差别，造就出两种全然不同的社会，就可以相信方法的效果足以惊人。递进自组织的两个要素——经验范围逐层递选和随时选举，作为方法都足以与竞选在同一量级，因此完全可以期待同样分量（如果不是两倍分量）的社会变革。</p>
<p lang="en">Recursive self-organization seems to be a simple approach, but can it achieve social change like the integration of power and people? If you look at the simple difference between campaigning and non-election, and create two completely different societies, you can believe that the effect of the method is striking. The two elements of recursive self-organization—recursive elect with in empirical range  and election at any time—are both sufficient as methods to be on the same magnitude as campaigns, so that societal change can be expected to carry the same weight, if not twice as much.</p>

<p lang="en">Here, "legislation" is used in a broad sense, referring to national laws, but it can also refer to the rules of a factory or the village agreements of a township, including various regulations. Therefore, any layer in the recursive self-organization can have this kind of "legislation." The difference lies in the fact that legislation at higher levels is precisely documented and suitable for judicial rulings, while lower-level layer blocks, with fewer people and easier communication, do not require formalities and can even be based on verbal agreements.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">公权组织的最高层块——如中国三十四个省市（直辖市）区（自治区）的当选首长加上他们选举的国家元首组成的国家委员会——按这种方式进行国家立法，会带来显而易见的质疑：这三十五人有足够代表性吗？又有没有足够的立法能力？或者他们有足够时间研究立法吗？而若把精力都放在立法上，又如何完成行政首长的职责呢？……</p>
<p lang="en">The highest level block of the public power organization—such as the National Committee composed of the elected heads of the thirty-four provinces, municipalities (direct-controlled municipalities), and regions (autonomous regions) in China, along with the elected national head—adopting this method for national legislation raises obvious questions: Are these thirty-five individuals representative enough? Do they possess sufficient legislative capability? Do they have enough time to dedicate to legislative research? And if they focus all their energy on legislation, how can they fulfill their responsibilities as administrative heads?</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">首先在递进自组织结构，这三十五人都受其所在省市区层块的选举者制约，立法不是按其个人意愿，而要得到各自选举者的赞同。假设每个省市区层块有下属三十个地州市长，就等于有上千人参加了国家立法。</p>
<p lang="en">Firstly, in the recursive self-organizing structure, these thirty-five individuals are constrained by the electors in their respective provinces, municipalities, or regions. Legislation is not based on their personal preferences but requires the approval of their respective electors. Assuming each province, municipality, or region has thirty lower-level mayors, this implies that over a thousand people are involved in national legislation.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">那些地州市长对重要立法也需征求各自选举者的意见……这样一层层推下去，最终可以囊括全体社会成员。并非说全体社会成员真的都会参与国家立法，但是递进自组织的结构与机制的确提供了这种可能。</p>
<p lang="en">Those lower-level mayors also need to seek the opinions of their respective electors on important legislation. ... As this process goes layer by layer, it eventually encompasses all members of society. It doesn't mean that every member of society will actually participate in national legislation, but the structure and mechanisms of recursive self-organization do provide this possibility.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">对立法者的能力和精力不必担心。一是递进自组织自下而上的层块自治决定了上层法律会被减到最少，立法工作量不会像现在这样往上层集中；二是层块越高资源越多，省市区级有专门的法律部门负责提出和研究法案。省市区首长参与国家层块的立法，不会需要很多的亲力投入，主要研究都是由下属部门完成，各层立法皆会如此。</p>
<p lang="en">There is no need to worry about the capacity and energy of legislators. Firstly, the bottom-up autonomy of recursive self-organization ensures that higher-level laws are minimized, and the legislative workload does not concentrate upward as much as it does now. Secondly, the higher the level of the block, the more resources are available, and at the provincial and municipal levels, there are specialized legal departments responsible for proposing and researching bills. The participation of provincial and municipal leaders in legislation at the national level will not require a significant personal investment of effort; the main research is carried out by subordinate departments, and this holds true for legislation at all levels.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">举例说，当相关职能部门草拟了汽车排放标准的新法案交给国家委员会审议时，各省市区首长不会亲自研究汽车尾气成分，先由其下属法律部门请各方评估，从本省经济、环境等方面提出修改，把意见报给首长及本省委员会各委员——即本省各地州市长。地州市长们也会让下属法律部门从经济、环境等方面评估，决定该地州市长在省委员会讨论法案时的立场。一般情况下，省市区首长会以下属地州市首长中的多数意见决定其在国家委员会对法案的投票。若省市区首长有三分之二赞成，方案方可成为法律。可以看出，之所以各级立法者不会承受不了立法负担，一方面是因为有职能部门分担，一方面是立法者只需按其当选层块的决议进行表态。这种立法可形容为自下而上的“递进立法”。</p>
<p lang="en">For example, when the relevant functional department drafts a new bill on automobile emission standards for review by the national committee, provincial and municipal leaders will not personally study the components of car exhaust. Instead, their subordinate legal departments will assess the perspectives from various aspects such as the province's economy and environment, propose modifications, and report the opinions to the leader and the committee of their province—consisting of mayors from various cities and counties within the province. The mayors will also instruct their subordinate legal departments to evaluate the economic and environmental aspects, deciding the stance of the city or county mayor during the discussion of the bill in the provincial committee. In general, provincial and municipal leaders will vote in accordance with the majority opinions of mayors from various cities and counties. If two-thirds of the provincial and municipal leaders agree, the proposal can become law. It can be seen that the reason why legislators at all levels can handle the legislative burden is because, on the one hand, functional departments share the load, and on the other hand, legislators only need to express their stance based on the resolutions of the elected layer block. This type of legislation can be described as a bottom-up "recursive legislation."</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span lang="zh-hans">司法</span> <span lang="en">Judiciary</span></h3>

<p lang="zh-hans">司法的专业性强，需由专家进行设计，因此司法的具体方式可在公权组织实行递进自组织后再加规划。随着递进自组织规则第八条实施所启动的自生自发机制，会通过反馈—调节的循环，为形成并完善司法体系补足所需的细节。</p>
<p lang="en">The professional nature of the judiciary requires design by experts. Therefore, the specific methods of the judiciary can be planned after the implementation of recursive self-organization within public power organizations. With the self-generating mechanism initiated by the implementation of rule 8 of the recursive self-organization, the feedback-adjustment loop will supplement the details needed to form and improve the judicial system.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">递进自组织社会的司法实践和法学理论会与今日有诸多不同，法律尽可能精简，“国家越糟法网越密”的状况改观，多数纠纷由下级层块自我仲裁和调解，无需进入司法程序。</p>
<p lang="en">The judicial practices and legal theories of the recursive self-organizing society differ significantly from those of today. The legal system is simplified as much as possible, and there is a shift from the situation where "the worse the state, the denser the legal network" occurs. Most disputes are resolved through self-arbitration and mediation at the lower levels, eliminating the need for involvement in the judicial process.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">例如，层块委员会对本层块发生的案件先行“初审”（跨层块案件由上一级委员会初审），做出裁决，若当事双方都能接受，便可就地解决，否则由不服的一方继续上诉，才进入正式的司法。这种初审不需要依据法律条文和确凿证据，而是借助类似传统社会的家族长老、乡村士绅、或社区领袖那类的评断因素——即良心、直觉、仁爱，以及个人的经验与智慧，以摆脱法律的繁琐，平衡法律的无情，降低法律成本。这不一定足够专业，但和陪审团的原理类似，是在直接听取当事人的控辩过程中，得出符合情理和良知的直觉判断，可以比法律更简洁地解决问题，且少留后患。</p>
<p lang="en">For example, the committee at the local level conducts a "preliminary review" of cases occurring within its jurisdiction (cross-level cases are reviewed by the committee at the higher level), makes a ruling, and if both parties accept it, the matter can be resolved locally. Otherwise, the dissatisfied party can continue to appeal, entering the formal judicial process. This preliminary review does not require adherence to legal statutes and concrete evidence. Instead, it relies on judgment factors similar to those in traditional societies, such as family elders, village gentry, or community leaders—factors like conscience, intuition, compassion, personal experience, and wisdom. This approach aims to escape the intricacies of the law, balance the law's relentlessness, and reduce legal costs. While not necessarily highly professional, similar to the principles of a jury, it involves deriving intuitive judgments in direct consideration of the arguments presented by the parties. This process results in decisions that align with reason and conscience, offering a potentially more concise resolution to problems than the legal system, with fewer potential complications.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">司法无情，只认条文，不论动机，犯法即为有罪。司法过程旷日费时，成本高昂，求助法律者往往不堪承受。只要进入法律程序，这些都无法避免，因为法律若有通融就会动摇根本。而初审可以先在人与法之间加一层缓冲，把动机和结果放在一起考虑。人不该因为无意或偶然犯错成为法定罪人，或是争执双方非得打出你赢我输。不过也不必担心会造成枉法，一方面层块委员会的成员始终在选举者制约下，另一方面初审结果不会被强制接受，不接受者仍可以把法律程序进行到底，因此既不会损害法律的严格，又给合理通情留下了空间。</p>
<p lang="en">Justice is unrelenting, recognizing only legal statutes and disregarding motives; breaking the law equates to guilt. The judicial process is time-consuming and expensive, making it unbearable for those seeking legal recourse. Once within the legal system, these issues are unavoidable, as any leniency in the law would undermine its foundation. Preliminary reviews, however, introduce a buffer between individuals and the law, allowing for the consideration of motives and outcomes together. People should not be condemned as legal offenders due to unintentional or accidental mistakes, and disputes need not necessarily result in a win-lose scenario. Concerns about potential miscarriages of justice are mitigated by the fact that, on one hand, the committee members are always constrained by the electorate, and on the other hand, the results of the preliminary review are not mandatory. Those who do not accept the decision can continue the legal process, ensuring both the preservation of legal rigor and the allowance of space for reasonable considerations.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">司法独立性不能太大，亦不能太小。无独立，难免不被社会情绪和行政需要裹挟，则法不成法；完全独立，又易陷入教条，反成为发展障碍。当相应层块的三分之二多数都反对司法官时，便可以认为其独立性超过了合理界限，应该调整。可随时选举司法官，与要求的司法稳定性并不构成矛盾。道理如前面谈选举时所说，随时选举只是一种含而不发的可能，使得当选者每次履责前在头脑中模拟选举，以得到多数的赞成，从而实际发生的选举可能比定期选举还少。</p>
<p lang="en">The independence of the judiciary should neither be too extensive nor too limited. Without independence, it is inevitable that legal processes will be influenced by societal emotions and administrative needs, rendering the law ineffective. On the other hand, complete independence may lead to dogmatism and become an obstacle to development. When a two-thirds majority of the corresponding local committee opposes a judicial official, it can be considered that their independence has exceeded a reasonable limit and should be adjusted. Judicial officials can be elected at any time, and this does not contradict the requirement for judicial stability. As discussed earlier in the context of elections, the possibility of elections at any time is a latent feature, causing elected officials to mentally simulate elections before assuming their responsibilities each time, aiming to secure the approval of the majority. Consequently, actual unscheduled elections may occur less frequently than regularly scheduled ones.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">作为公权力，递进自组织随时选举之结果须有法律确认和公示，保证当选者被上级层块接纳，防止冒名顶替或各执一词，这是上级检察官的职责。检察官还负责众权组织纳入公权组织的认定，查证众权组织成员数量，决定其票权，授予其权限等。这些查证对于人工操作而言相当繁复，对计算机和网络技术则轻而易举。各级检察官的另一职责是检查下级层块的立法，如发现与上级立法相冲突，须要求修改，或起诉法院裁决。</p>
<p lang="en">As a public authority, the results of unscheduled elections in the recursive self-organizing system must undergo legal confirmation and public disclosure. This ensures that the elected individuals are accepted by the higher-level committee, preventing impersonation or conflicting claims. This responsibility falls under the duties of the higher-level prosecutor. The prosecutor is also responsible for determining the inclusion of various organizational powers into the public authority organization, verifying the number of members, deciding their voting rights, and granting them permissions. These verifications are quite complex for manual operation but are straightforward for computer and network technologies. Another responsibility of prosecutors at different levels is to review legislation at lower levels. If any conflicts with higher-level legislation are identified, modifications must be requested, or legal action may be taken to challenge the court's ruling.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">警察应该由行政首长管辖。因为除了执法功能，警察还有大量社会服务和行政服务，不能出现行政首长指挥不灵的情况，因此警察首脑应由相应层块的行政首长任命。不必担心警察成为行政首长的私人工具，一是行政首长受层块随时选举的制约，无法滥用权力；二是层块对任命有否决权，随时可以用二分之一否决将警察局长撤职；三是警察执法还会受到检察系统和法院系统制衡。</p>
<p lang="en">The police should be under the jurisdiction of the administrative head. Apart from their law enforcement function, the police are also involved in a significant amount of social and administrative services. To prevent situations where the administrative head's command is ineffective, the head of the police force should be appointed by the administrative head of the corresponding local committee. There is no need to worry about the police becoming a personal tool for the administrative head for several reasons: First, the administrative head is constrained by the possibility of unscheduled elections at the local committee level, preventing the abuse of power. Second, the local committee has the power to veto appointments and can revoke the appointment of the police chief with a two-thirds majority vote at any time. Third, the law enforcement activities of the police are subject to checks and balances from the prosecutorial and judicial systems.</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span lang="zh-hans">制衡</span><span lang="en">Checks and balances</span></h3>

<p lang="zh-hans">递进自组织不能只靠人自觉遵守规则，必须考虑人性可能存在的问题。建立足够制约，既让下级有约束上级的能力，也让上级有约束下级的能力。前者保证自由，后者保证秩序，二者不可或缺。</p>
<p lang="en">Recursive self-organization cannot rely solely on individuals conscientiously following the rules; it must take into account the potential issues inherent in human nature. Establishing sufficient constraints is essential, allowing lower levels to have the ability to constrain higher levels, and vice versa. The former ensures freedom, while the latter ensures order; both are indispensable.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">在递进自组织规则中，相应的制约分散于不同条文，不一定能得到凸显，因此不惮重复，这里继续细谈。</p>
<p lang="en">In the recursive self-organization rules, the corresponding constraints are scattered in different provisions and may not be highlighted, so they are not afraid to be repeated, and we will continue to discuss them in detail here.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">递进自组织中，下级约束上级的根本能力在随时选举，但是有些情况未到需要重新选举的地步，如只对当选人的某个决策有异议，并非想更换当选人，便可通过层块表决的方式，只要超过二分之一票权否决，当选人的决策即需废止。</p>
<p lang="en">In recursive self-organization, the fundamental ability for lower levels to constrain higher levels lies in the option of unscheduled elections. However, there are situations that may not warrant a full re-election, such as having objections to a specific decision made by the elected official without the intention of replacing them. In such cases, a vote within the local committee can be employed. If more than half of the voting rights oppose the decision, it is deemed null and void without necessitating a full re-election.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">这种否决方式是可以向下延伸的——即层块的下属层块成员也可进行这种表决。例如乡镇长组成的县级层块做出的决策受到村级当选人质疑，县级层块却不为所动时，村级当选人便可相互串联进行表决，全县村级当选人的否决票权若能达到二分之一，县级层块的决策同样要废止。如此可以继续向下延伸，直至全体选民以一人一票进行表决——即公决。</p>
<p lang="en">This veto mechanism can be extended downward, allowing members of subordinate levels to participate in such voting. For instance, if a decision made by a county-level committee, composed of township mayors, is challenged by elected officials at the village level and the county-level committee remains unresponsive, the village-level elected officials can connect and conduct a vote. If more than half of the vetoing votes from all village-level elected officials in the county are obtained, the decision of the county-level committee is likewise annulled. This process can continue to cascade downward until it reaches a point where all eligible voters cast their votes on a one-person-one-vote basis — in other words, a referendum.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">逐层递选的制约能力在没有被实践充分验证前，会担心因为中间隔了层次而使普通选民无法表达对宏观事项的关注，以及不满高层却没有管道施加影响，因此需要为这种担心保留打破隔层的手段。上述方法正是普通民众，包括政党、NGO、在野政客等都可利用的——不管哪个层次，多大范围，只要能在相应范围内动员到二分之一的票权，即可否定该范围最高层块的决策或官员任命。对于进行这种直接介入，今日代议政治的许多手段仍能大显身手。</p>
<p lang="en">The constraining power of recursive elections at each level may raise concerns before being fully tested in practice. There might be worries that the existence of intermediate levels could hinder ordinary voters from expressing their concerns on macro-level issues and expressing dissatisfaction with higher levels without a channel to exert influence. Hence, there is a need to retain mechanisms to address these concerns by breaking through these hierarchical layers. The above-mentioned methods are precisely tools that ordinary citizens, including political parties, NGOs, and opposition politicians, can utilize. Regardless of the level or scope, as long as they can mobilize half of the voting rights within the corresponding scope, they can annul decisions or official appointments made by the highest-level committee within that scope. Many means of direct intervention, prevalent in today's representative politics, can still be effective in this context.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">将公权力横向分割为立法、行政、司法，使其各自独立的分权制衡，在西方政治思想中被认为是保障自由的基石。但分权不是唯一的制衡方式。递进自组织把公权力划分给每个层次的每个层块，使其自治，再把不同的自治体合成更大的自治体。在这种合权过程中，也一样可以产生制衡，我称“合权制衡”——从个人开始，随递进自组织自下而上合成更大的自治体，不断通过协商进行决策和立法，通过随时选举产生“和载体”，既是把自治权合在一起的过程，也是相互进行制衡的过程。递进的层块越高，下属自治体越多，形成的合权制衡也就越强。</p>
<p lang="en">The horizontal division of governmental power into legislative, executive, and judicial branches, allowing for their independent separation of powers, is considered a cornerstone for safeguarding freedom in Western political thought. However, the separation of powers is not the sole mechanism for checks and balances. In recursive self-organization, public authority is allocated to each level and block, granting them autonomy. These autonomous entities are then synthesized into larger autonomous entities. In this process of combined authority, a system of checks and balances, which I refer to as "combined authority checks and balances", can also emerge. Starting from individuals and progressing through the synthesis of larger autonomous entities from the bottom up in recursive self-organization, decisions and legislation are continually made through negotiation. The "sum carrier" is generated through unscheduled elections, serving as both the process of consolidating autonomous powers and a mechanism for mutual checks and balances. The higher the recursive level of the block, and the more subordinate autonomous entities, the stronger the checks and balances in the formed combined authority.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">如果分权的目的是打破公权力一统，使其不被同一官僚机构肆意滥用，自治是比分权更有效的方式。有多少自治体就有多少分权，比三权的分权更多，同时自治体内又可保持公权力的一体，避免分权所导致的 vetocracy，有利于公共服务。</p>
<p lang="en">If the purpose of decentralization is to break the monopoly of public authority and prevent arbitrary abuse by the same bureaucratic institution, autonomy is a more effective means than decentralization. Each autonomous entity represents a form of decentralization, exceeding the three branches' decentralization. Simultaneously, within each autonomous entity, the unity of public authority can be maintained, avoiding the vetocracy resulting from decentralization and benefiting public services.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">人们会担心，递进自组织的各层块皆自治，能否保证统一管理？会不会出现本位至上，拒绝妥协，不顾全局的情况？其实这种问题代议制也同样存在，事实证明可以解决。相比之下，递进自组织应该解决得更好。一方面有逐层提炼理性的性质（见下章）；另一方面只要成员或成员体寻求合作，便不会一意孤行，否则就得不到合作。</p>
<p lang="en">People might be concerned whether the autonomy of each level and block in recursive self-organization can ensure unified management. Will there be a tendency towards parochialism, refusal to compromise, and disregard for the overall situation? In reality, such concerns exist in representative systems as well, and experience has shown that they can be addressed. In comparison, recursive self-organization should be able to address these issues more effectively. On the one hand, it possesses a nature of refining reason layer by layer (see the next chapter). On the other hand, as long as members or entities seek cooperation, they will not act unilaterally; otherwise, cooperation will not be forthcoming.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">虽然递进自组织也有司法和强力，但是杯葛会作为制约不合作或不守约的主要方式。假设某个“和载体”拒不执行上级法律和决策，并受到选举其的层块支持，其他层块可联合起来对其进行杯葛。因为上级法律和决策是自下而上做出的，该层块拒绝的便不是上级，而是其他层块。这是其他层块对其联合杯葛的正当性所在。递进自组织的机制容易实现联合杯葛。任何层块遭遇联合杯葛，造成的困境会远大于其接受上级法律和决策带来的暂时不爽。如果其继续坚持对抗，最终亦可以将其逐出共同体。</p>
<p lang="en">While recursive self-organization includes judicial and coercive elements, boycotts serve as the primary means of constraining non-cooperation or violation of agreements. Suppose a "sum carrier" refuses to comply with higher-level laws and decisions and receives support from its electing block. In that case, other blocks can unite to boycott it. Since higher-level laws and decisions are made from the bottom up, the block in question is rejecting not the higher level but other blocks. This is where the legitimacy of other blocks' joint boycott lies. The mechanisms of recursive self-organization make it easy to implement joint boycotts. Any block facing a joint boycott will experience more significant difficulties than the temporary discomfort caused by accepting higher-level laws and decisions. If it persists in resistance, it can eventually be expelled from the community.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">被逐出者（或自动退出者）可以加入接受其的共同体，也可和其他志同道合者组建新共同体。递进自组织提供相应的制度安排。但也不排除个别人无论如何无法合作，总是冲动行事、甚至蓄谋犯罪；或是有些情况不允许用逐出方式解决，如国家不会将某块地域连同其上拒绝合作的共同体逐出。但如同任何民主国家对此类情况都有相应手段一样，递进自组织社会也会有防止犯罪的机构，以及军队警察等作为守护法律和秩序的最终手段，同时会像任何民主国家那样受到不可滥用强力的制约。</p>
<p lang="en">The expelled individual (or one who voluntarily exits) has the option to join a community that accepts them or form a new community with like-minded individuals. Recursive self-organization provides corresponding institutional arrangements for such situations. However, it doesn't rule out the possibility that certain individuals may be unable to cooperate, consistently acting impulsively or even planning criminal activities. Additionally, there may be situations where expulsion is not an appropriate solution, such as when a country will not expel a region along with a community that refuses to cooperate within it. Similar to how any democratic country has means to address such scenarios, a recursive self-organizing society will have institutions to prevent crime, and forces like the military and police to serve as the ultimate means of safeguarding law and order. These mechanisms will be subject to constraints against undue use of force, similar to any democratic nation.</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc"><span lang="zh-hans">关于僵局</span><span lang="en">About the impasse</span></h3>

<p lang="zh-hans">这是对递进自组织可行性的主要担心之一。以三分之二决选举和决策，需要很高的共识度，否则会陷入选不出人或做不出决策的僵局。美国民主党曾实行党代表大会以三分之二多数提名总统候选人，最多时经过 103 轮投票才得到结果，最终不得不改为简单多数提名。而递进自组织的僵局不仅在于一个环节，假设某乡镇有十个村，其中四个村陷入选举僵局导致村长空缺，其他六个村的村长达不到乡镇层块的三分之二，就无法选举乡镇长，乡镇行政管理随之瘫痪。这种僵局可以不断向上延伸，推而广之，整个递进自组织公权体系都可能因此瘫痪。如果采用任期制，想方设法过一次关至少能维持几年。递进自组织的随时选举则意味僵局和瘫痪随时可能发生。“坚定少数派” 即使不能达到自己目的，只要能过三分之一，就可以在面对无穷议题的过程中随时行使否决权，通过造成上述之连锁瘫痪使体制停摆，让自己反对的对象不能上任，或让反对的事项无法进行。</p>
<p lang="en">This is one of the main concerns regarding the feasibility of recursive self-organization. Requiring a two-thirds majority for elections and decision-making demands a high level of consensus; otherwise, it can lead to a deadlock where individuals cannot be elected or decisions cannot be made. The Democratic Party in the United States once implemented a two-thirds majority requirement for nominating presidential candidates during their party conventions. At its peak, it took 103 rounds of voting to reach a decision, eventually necessitating a shift to a simple majority nomination. The deadlock in recursive self-organization is not limited to a single link. For instance, if a township consists of ten villages and four of them are deadlocked in elections for village chiefs, resulting in vacancies, and the remaining six villages cannot achieve a two-thirds majority for electing the township chief, the administrative management of the township comes to a standstill. This deadlock can propagate upwards and, if widespread, could potentially paralyze the entire power structure of the recursive self-organizing system. If fixed terms were adopted, successfully navigating a deadlock at least ensures stability for a few years. In the case of unscheduled elections in recursive self-organization, deadlock and paralysis could occur at any time. The "resolute minority" could wield veto power by achieving a one-third threshold, causing a chain reaction of paralysis, preventing the appointment of individuals they oppose or blocking unfavorable measures during the ongoing deliberative process on numerous issues.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">这种担心当然有道理。但是“坚定少数派”在递进自组织中不会成为常态。既然基层层块是自由组合，总处于反对状态并且不妥协的人就不会进入组合，而是去加入其不反对的组合。自由组合当然也会出现不同意见，但基本状态是共识与合作，各方会有妥协心（否则组合解散）。少数派即使对最后结果仍未满意，身处长期合作的共同体，知道让步会在自己下次成为多数派时得到补偿，明白遵守少数服从多数的规则对每个成员都有好处。</p>
<p lang="en">This concern is certainly reasonable. However, the "resolute minority" is not expected to become a common occurrence in recursive self-organization. Since the grassroots blocks are freely formed, those consistently in opposition and unwilling to compromise are unlikely to join such formations but instead opt for groups that align with their views. While diverse opinions may arise within freely formed groups, the fundamental state is one of consensus and cooperation. All parties involved will possess a spirit of compromise (or else the formation would dissolve). Even if a minority remains dissatisfied with the final outcome, being part of a long-term cooperative community, they understand that concessions may be compensated when they become the majority in the future. Members recognize that adhering to the rule of majority rule benefits everyone in the community.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">同样道理也适用于上级层块。其成员为下级层块当选人，会较少带入个人意气，更为理性、知道分寸和善于交易（包括妥协）。而层块规模限制在充分直接沟通的范围，比起美国民主党代表大会那种难以沟通的规模，取得共识更是容易得多。</p>
<p lang="en">The same reasoning applies to higher-level blocks as well. Members of these blocks, being elected representatives from lower-level blocks, are less likely to bring personal sentiments into the decision-making process. They tend to be more rational, discerning, and adept at negotiations, including compromise. Moreover, the size of the blocks is limited to a range that allows for direct and effective communication. In contrast to the challenging communication dynamics in large-scale assemblies like the Democratic National Convention in the United States, achieving consensus in these smaller, more communicative blocks is considerably easier.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">公权组织的上级层块一般不能自由组合，如乡镇不能退出此县加入彼县。当多数乡镇决定把垃圾场建到某处，周围乡镇的当选人在本地民众群情激奋的要求下坚决不同意，形成“坚定少数派”的情况可能发生，垃圾场因此无法建设。但这未见得是坏事。试想在超过三分之一的反对时，以二分之一决强行通过强制执行是否就好？三分之一强的反对即使一时被压制，矛盾仍在。实行二分之一决将会不断制造和积累这种矛盾，直到积重难返。三分之二决的基本理念在于共识度不达到相当程度，宁可议而不决，修改方案，寻求进一步妥协，也不要压下矛盾换得的效率。民主决策从来不会比专制决策的效率高，却正是民主的优越所在。好的议题被耽搁没什么了不得，好事不怕晚。即使是紧急事务，耽搁了地球也照转。如果真是不能延误的情况，大家都会受伤害，相信在可以充分沟通的范围内，理性一定能找到超过三分之二共识的合适决策。</p>
<p lang="en">Higher-level blocks within the public power organization generally cannot form freely, meaning townships cannot withdraw from one county to join another. Consider a scenario where the majority of townships decide to build a landfill at a specific location, but elected officials from surrounding townships vehemently disagree due to impassioned demands from local residents, forming a situation akin to a "resolute minority." In this case, the landfill may not be constructed. However, this may not necessarily be a bad outcome. Imagine if, with more than one-third opposition, a decision were forcibly passed with a two-thirds vote. Would this be preferable? Even if the one-third strong opposition is temporarily suppressed, the underlying conflict persists. Enforcing a two-thirds decision would continually create and accumulate such conflicts, reaching an unsustainable level. The fundamental concept behind a two-thirds decision is that if consensus is not reached to a significant extent, it is better to engage in further deliberation, modify the proposal, seek additional compromise, rather than suppressing conflicts for the sake of efficiency. Democratic decision-making has never been more efficient than autocratic decision-making; however, its superiority lies in its democratic principles. Delaying a good proposal is inconsequential, and good things are not afraid of being delayed. Even in urgent matters, the world will continue to turn, and if it is genuinely a situation that cannot be delayed, everyone will be harmed. Trust that within the scope of sufficient communication, rationality can find a suitable decision that surpasses a two-thirds consensus.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">共同体内若是产生了无论如何不能化解的反对派，持续僵持，阵营固化，如支持同性婚姻和反对同性婚姻，或不同民族的群体，那就说明共同体应该分家，各过各的。递进自组织为这种分离提供相应的机制。</p>
<p lang="en">If within a community, an irreconcilable opposition emerges, persisting in a deadlock with solidified factions — for example, supporting and opposing same-sex marriage or different ethnic groups — it indicates that the community should consider splitting, allowing each group to go their separate ways. recursive self-organization provides mechanisms to facilitate such separations when necessary.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">有些观点分歧是大规模人群面对宏观问题时产生的，往往出于偏见与局限的数量求和。加上常人对宏观问题的表态无需承担直接责任，因而不认真思考，容易跟着感觉随波逐流。而处于经验范围则会不一样，如笼统而言时强烈反对同性婚姻的人，面对熟人的同性婚姻会变得宽容，至少不那么极端。递进自组织会把这种经验范围的宽容聚合为总体的更宽容，而把数量迭加的不宽容隔离在决策之外。</p>
<p lang="en">Some differences in viewpoints arise when large populations confront macroscopic issues, often stemming from the sum of biases and limitations. Additionally, since individuals expressing their opinions on macroscopic issues don't bear direct responsibility, they may not think seriously and may be prone to following the prevailing tide based on feelings. However, when experiences come into play, the dynamics can be different. For instance, someone who strongly opposes same-sex marriage in a general sense may become more tolerant when faced with a same-sex marriage involving someone they know, at least not being as extreme. recursive self-organization aggregates this tolerance within the scope of personal experiences to foster overall greater tolerance while isolating, outside the decision-making process, the intolerance that accumulates through sheer numerical aggregation.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">通过协商总能找出解决僵局之道，之所以追求民主就因秉持这种信心。当然还要有相应的制度安排。例如选举进入无法产生三分之二多数的僵局时，可以让选举者按优先选择对候选人排序，统计所有选举者的排序，将总排序最高的前几人再由选举者排序，反复淘汰后，直到产生三分之二多数。如果一直无人超过三分之二，可以让得票最多者为代理人。代理人行使职能有限，日常决策不可全权，需本层块其他成员共同参与。如果代理人表现好，不久会通过三分之二，或是在层块集体行政过程中有新人展露头角，逐步得到超过三分之二的信任。</p>
<p lang="en">Through negotiation, a solution to any deadlock can always be found, and it is this confidence that underlies the pursuit of democracy. Of course, corresponding institutional arrangements are necessary. For example, when elections fail to produce a two-thirds majority, a deadlock resolution can be achieved by having the electors prioritize and rank the candidates. The rankings from all electors are compiled, and the top few candidates are then ranked again by the electors. This process is repeated until a two-thirds majority is reached. If no candidate consistently achieves a two-thirds majority, the candidate with the highest overall votes can act as a proxy. The proxy has limited authority and cannot make unilateral decisions in day-to-day matters; instead, the other members of the same block must participate in decision-making. If the proxy performs well, they will soon gain the trust of two-thirds of the block, or as new talents emerge during the collective administrative process, gradually earn the trust necessary to surpass a two-thirds majority.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">另外一种可采取的措施是，因为代表性不够，代理人在上级层块的表决票权将被减少一半。这对该层块的总体利益是不利的，因此可以起到促使放弃僵持、尽快以三分之二多数选出正式当选人的作用。</p>
<p lang="en">Another measure that can be adopted is to reduce the voting weight of proxy representatives by half in the decision-making process of the higher-level block due to their lack of direct representation. This is disadvantageous for the overall interests of the block, serving as an incentive for breaking the deadlock and quickly electing a formally elected representative with a two-thirds majority.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">上面说的措施只是举例，为的是说明可以设想各种制度安排避免僵局和瘫痪。具体细节现在不必太追究，当递进自组织的机制开始运转，便会逐步形成最佳方式。</p>
<p lang="en">The measures mentioned above are only examples to illustrate that institutional arrangements can be envisaged to avoid impasse and paralysis.

<p lang="zh-hans">至于对政治极化的担心——有人就是为反对而反对，甚至把在政治领域兴风作浪当作人生意义和乐趣，千方百计制造冲突——那本是二元社会产生的怪胎，为争夺私有权力无所不用其极。无论是极权社会的宫廷斗争、阶级斗争，还是代议制的政党竞争，或是精英主导的民族主义、国家主义，都以斗争为本，整人搞事的政客和相应的政治文化便是在这种土壤上生长的。在递进自组织社会，“纸牌屋”式的政治技巧将失去用武之地。当不再有私有权力供其追逐，职业政客也会失去动力。届时现实不满有管道释放，历史恩怨会随时间淡出，二元社会看似与生俱来的政治丑恶亦将自我消失。</p>
<p lang="en">As for concerns about political polarization—where some individuals oppose merely for the sake of opposition, treating political turmoil and conflict as a source of meaning and enjoyment in life—that is an anomaly born of dualistic societies, where individuals go to extreme lengths to acquire private power. Whether it's the palace intrigue in authoritarian societies, class struggles, party competitions in representative democracy, or elite-driven nationalism and patriotism, the foundation of all these scenarios is built on the essence of struggle. Politicians who thrive on stirring up trouble and engaging in political mischief grow in the soil of such environments. In a recursive self-organizing society, the kind of political maneuvering seen in a "house of cards" will become obsolete. When there is no longer private power to pursue, career politicians will lose their motivation. At that point, avenues for expressing dissatisfaction will exist, historical grievances will fade with time, and the seemingly inherent political ugliness of dualistic societies will gradually disappear.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">人类学描述定居社会的父系群，往往由数位已成为祖父的堂兄弟各率数个核心家庭构成，群的人数恰好接近邓巴数（Dunbar’s number）。而数个这种父系群的家长，又可以进一步组成合作联盟，使规模扩大到数百人。这时超出邓巴数的下级成员发生冲突时，由双方家长解决，或提交家长会议裁断。递进地增加这种层级，让每一级都保持在邓巴数内，形成的多级宗族组织可达到数千或上万人规模。</p>
<p lang="en">Anthropologically, settled societies often consist of patrilineal clans led by several grandfathers who are cousins, each leading several core families. The size of the clan typically aligns closely with Dunbar's number. The parents of multiple such patrilineal clans can form cooperative alliances, expanding the scale to several hundred individuals. When conflicts arise among members exceeding Dunbar's number, the parents of the conflicting parties may resolve the issue or submit it to a parent council for judgment. recursively adding these hierarchical levels, each staying within Dunbar's number, results in multi-layered kinship organizations that can reach sizes of several thousand or even tens of thousands of people.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">最早见诸文字记载的自下而上递进结构是八百年前的《成吉思汗法典》第二十三条——“军队编组实行十进制……十人推举十夫长，十夫长推举百夫长，百夫长推举千夫长”。成吉思汗并非真搞民主，他只在军队实行这种自下而上的逐层递选，但其军队无敌天下，足以看出效用。</p>
<p lang="en">The earliest recorded example of a bottom-up recursive structure appears in the "Code of Genghis Khan," documented 800 years ago in its 23rd section: "The army is organized in a decimal system... Ten men elect a unit leader, ten unit leaders elect a hundred-unit leader, and a hundred-unit leader elects a thousand-unit leader." Genghis Khan did not practice democracy in the true sense; he implemented this bottom-up, hierarchical election system only within his military. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of his army, which was unparalleled, demonstrates the utility of such a structure.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">历史上寻求直接参与的民主尝试，基本都采用分层递进结构。阿伦特列举法国革命的革命协会，1871年的巴黎公社，1905年和1917年的俄国苏维埃，1956年匈牙利革命的评议会，都有与递进自组织相似的特征:一是自发形成（自组织）而非由政治家创建；二是通过协商达成秩序；三是直接面对面交流的小型组织；四是低层委员会推举代表参加上一级委员会，形成金字塔式逐层推举的结构。阿伦特总结的上述特征并未都得到实现，往往只是略显萌芽，或停留于理念。但这并没有妨碍阿伦特从中看出小型委员会逐层递进取代国家，最终达至世界联邦的前景。</p>
<p lang="en">Throughout history, attempts at direct participatory democracy have generally employed a hierarchical recursive structure. Hannah Arendt cites examples such as the revolutionary associations during the French Revolution, the Paris Commune of 1871, the Russian Soviets of 1905 and 1917, and the councils of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. These instances share similarities with the principles of recursive self-organization: they spontaneously formed (self-organizing) rather than being created by politicians; they established order through negotiation; they consisted of small organizations engaging in face-to-face communication; and they featured lower-level committees electing representatives to participate in higher-level committees, creating a pyramid-like structure of recursive elections. Arendt acknowledges that not all of these characteristics were fully realized, often remaining in a nascent stage or confined to the realm of ideas. However, this did not prevent Arendt from envisioning a prospect where small committees, progressing hierarchically, could replace the nation-state, ultimately leading to the formation of a global federation.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">要回答的是：为什么历史上的递进组织结构没有成为普及的民主形式，反而会被专制权力利用（如苏维埃制度和中国的人大制度）？递进自组织与那些递进结构的不同在哪里？</p>
<p lang="en">The question to be answered is: why did the historical recursive organizational structures not become a universal form of democracy, but were instead used by authoritarian powers (such as the Soviet system and the Chinese people's congress system)? How is recursive self-organization different from those recursive structures?</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">——关键在于“层块规模不大于层块所有成员皆可充分直接沟通的限度”（递进自组织规则一）。在组织发展期间。人数增加总是令人鼓舞的，似乎越多越好，但若不能有意识地及时通过裂变和分层限制层块规模，一超出可充分沟通的限度，前面讲过的主持人、权组织、二元结构等都会出现。</p>
<p lang="en">The key lies in the rule of "the size of the block should not exceed the limit at which all members of the layer block can communicate sufficiently" (Rule 1 of Recursive Self-Organization). During the development of an organization, an increase in the number of people is often seen as encouraging, seemingly indicating that more is better. However, if the size of the block exceeds the limit at which all members can communicate sufficiently, problems such as the emergence of leaders, centralized power structures, and dualistic systems, as discussed earlier, are likely to occur.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">基层层块是递进自组织的起点，其能否保持自组织性质，决定递进自组织能否真正形成。然而以往不看重基层，注意力都在高层。如同原始数据有问题，后面的运算再严谨也不会真实。若不能自觉将基层规模限制在可充分直接沟通的范围，对当选者的制约即失效。其参与上级层块便不依从共同体意志而依从其个人意志，权与民的断裂也就发生，后面的递进皆会脱离自组织，成为权组织活动。民众仍然是无权的。从法国革命到俄国革命，都是这样的轨迹。</p>
<p lang="en">The grassroots layer block is the starting point of recursive self-organization, and its ability to maintain self-organizational characteristics determines whether recursive self-organization can truly take shape. However, in the past, there has been insufficient emphasis on the grassroots, with attention often focused on the higher levels. Similar to how inaccurate raw data can compromise the accuracy of subsequent calculations, if the size of the grassroots block is not consciously limited to a empirical range where all members can communicate sufficiently, the constraints on elected representatives become ineffective. Their participation in higher-level blocks will then be based on personal will rather than adhering to the collective will of the community, leading to a rupture between power and the people. Subsequent progressions will deviate from self-organization, becoming activities of power organization, and the people will still lack real influence. This trajectory has been observed from the French Revolution to the Russian Revolution.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">事实上，无论在民间社会还是在互联网空间，第一级自组织总会不断自发产生，但始终未能让自组织突破到第二层，原因就是没有自觉限制规模，没有适时地通过裂变形成分层。而一旦超出了能够充分直接沟通的规模，就会被主持者掌控，成为其个人领地，演变为权组织加被组织的二元结构。</p>
<p lang="en">In fact, whether in civil society or in the online space, the first level of self-organization continually emerges spontaneously, but it has consistently failed to break through to the second level. The reason for this lies in the lack of conscious size limitation and the failure to timely undergo fission to form hierarchical structures. Once the size exceeds the capacity for sufficient direct communication, it falls under the control of a moderator, becoming their personal domain and evolving into a dualistic structure of power organization and the organized.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">从马克思到列宁，都强调新政权随时以选举撤换公职人员，或随时召回苏维埃代表，却有名无实，原因也在于规模。当成员之间已经无法充分沟通，就不可能自发串联进行重新选举或做出召回决定。控制权在主持人手中，即便“随时召回”当年被冠冕堂皇地写进了苏联宪法，也只是无意义的文字。只有始终保证所有成员无需主持即可充分沟通，“随时”才可能成为真实。</p>
<p lang="en">From Marx to Lenin, the emphasis on the new political power's ability to replace public officials through elections or to recall Soviet representatives at any time is rendered ineffective due to the issue of scale. When members can no longer communicate effectively, spontaneous coordination for re-elections or recall decisions becomes impossible. With control in the hands of moderators, the notion of "recalling at any time," even if gloriously written into the Soviet constitution, remains meaningless. Only by ensuring that all members can communicate fully without the need for moderators can the concept of "at any time" become a reality.</p>

<p lang="zh-hans">明白这些，就会清楚为什么中国人大制度形式上与递进自组织貌似，实质却全然不同。其规定乡级和县级直接选举人大代表，恰是把层块置于无法沟通的规模。乡镇通常几万人，县则几十万到上百万人，这种规模切断了民众对权力的沟通。而后面的逐层递选——市级和省级人大代表由县级人大代表选举；全国人大代表由省级人大代表选举；人大常委会由全国人大选举……同样也被当局用规模切断直接沟通。如各省市区的人大代表少则四、五百人，多则八、九百人，全国人大代表更是近三千人（2016年为2943名）。每年代表们从不同地方临时聚集开几天会，五年一次选举，加上不许串联的纪律，人大成为橡皮图章和表决傀儡一点也不奇怪。专制政权以选举制造合法性假象，主要就是利用规模。中国人大制度典型地展示了阿伦特所推崇的递进组织结构如何被搞成南辕北辙。</p>
<p lang="en">Understanding these points makes it clear why the Chinese system of the National People's Congress (NPC) may appear similar in form to recursive self-organization but is fundamentally different in essence. The system mandates the direct election of NPC deputies at the township and county levels, placing the layers at a scale where communication becomes impossible. Townships typically have tens of thousands of residents, while counties have populations ranging from several hundred thousand to over a million. This scale severs communication between the people and the exercise of power. The subsequent recursive elections—where city and provincial-level NPC deputies are elected by county-level NPC deputies, national NPC deputies are elected by provincial-level NPC deputies, and the NPC Standing Committee is elected by the National People's Congress—are also used by the authorities to cut off direct communication. The number of NPC deputies in various provinces and municipalities ranges from four to five hundred to eight or nine hundred, with the National People's Congress having nearly three thousand members (2943 in 2016). The annual brief gatherings of representatives, the five-yearly elections, and the prohibition on forming alliances contribute to making the NPC a rubber stamp and a puppet for decisions. The authoritarian regime employs elections to create the illusion of legitimacy, primarily by leveraging scale. China's NPC system is a typical example of how the recursive organizational structure advocated by Arendt is turned on its head.</p>
